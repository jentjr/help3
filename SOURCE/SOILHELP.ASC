  4.6.1  SOIL AND DESIGN DATA FILE SELECTION                                    
#FILE                                                                           
                                                                                
       The first screen in the soil and design module is the "Soil and Design   
  Data - File Editing" screen.  A schematic of this screen is shown in Figure   
  13.  On this screen the user may enter the file name of an existing file to   
  select a previously generated HELP Version 3 file for editing or leave the    
  file name blank to create new data.  The soil and design data file may have   
  any valid DOS name of up to 8 characters.  If the user enters an illegal      
  file name, the program displays "BAD FILE NAME" and clears the file name.     
  If the user specifies a file name that does not exist, the program displays   
  "FILE NOT FOUND" and clears the file name.  The HELP program adds an          
  extension of ".D10" to the file name.  As such, the user should not specify   
  the extension in HELP Version 3 whenever entering a file name for editing or  
  saving.                                                                       
#PATH                                                                           
                                                                                
       When selecting a file to be edited, the DOS path may be specified if     
  different from the active or default drive and subdirectory, such as          
  C:\HELP3\DATA.  The default directory is initially displayed in the           
  directory cell on the screen.  If the user specifies a drive or a directory   
  that does not exist, the program will display respectively "INVALID DRIVE"    
  or "INVALID DIRECTORY" and replaces the content with the default directory.   
                                                                                
       As shown in  Figure 13, the user may obtain a listing of all soil and    
  design data files that reside on the directory currently specified in the     
  directory cell by pressing F4.  Up to 120 data files can be displayed on the  
  screen.  The name of the current directory where these files are located is   
  also displayed.  To change to another directory, the user should enter the    
  name of that directory in the column labeled DIRECTORY.  To select a file     
  from the list of displayed files, move the cursor to the file and select it   
  by pressing Enter.  This transfers control back to the previous screen and    
  the name of the file just selected will be displayed in the proper cell.      
  The user can exit the list-of-files screen without selecting a file by        
  pressing F4 again or Esc.                                                     
#FILE                                                                           
#PATH                                                                           
                                                                                
       When ready to proceed to enter new data or edit existing data, the user  
  should press Page Down or F10.  The program then reads the data file to be    
  edited, if a file is specified, and proceeds to the "Landfill General         
  Information" screen.  If a new data set is to be created (file name left      
  blank), the program initializes the soil and design data and then asks for    
  the system of units to be used throughout the module (Customary or Metric).   
  Proper units are displayed throughout the module for entries that require     
  units.                                                                        
                                                                                
#D10EDIT                                                                        
#UNITS                                                                          
                                                                                
  8.  System of Units.  Throughout the HELP program the user is required to     
      select a system of units.  The HELP model allows the user to use either   
      the customary system of units (a mixture of U.S. and metric units         
      traditionally used in landfill design and in Version 2 of the HELP        
      model) or the Metric system of units.  The user is not restricted to the  
      same system for all data types; for example, the soil and design data     
      can be in one system of units and the weather data can be in the other    
      system.  Moreover, it is not necessary for all types of weather data to   
      have the same system of units, i.e. evapotranspiration data may be in     
      the Metric system of units while precipitation data can be in customary   
      units; the solar radiation data can be in customary units while           
      temperature data can be Metric units, and so on.  Appropriate units are   
      displayed in proper locations to keep the user aware of which units       
      should be used for each data entry.  Consistency in units is only         
      required within each data type.                                           
#UNITS                                                                          
#LANDFILL                                                                       
                                                                                
  4.6.2  LANDFILL GENERAL INFORMATION                                           
#TITLE                                                                          
                                                                                
       The second input screen in the soil and design data module is the        
  "Landfill General Information" screen.  Figure 14 shows the screen and its    
  branches as a schematic.  By moving the cursor to the appropriate cell, the   
  user can enter new information or edit the information that was read from     
  the edit file.  The first entry is the project title which is only used for   
  identification of the simulation.                                             
#TITLE                                                                          
#AREA                                                                           
                                                                                
       The second entry on this screen is the landfill area.  The units of the  
  area are displayed next to the input cell according to the system of units    
  selected.  The user should enter the area in acres for Customary units or in  
  hectares for Metric units (1 hectare = 2.47104 acres).  The area is used      
  only for computing the water balance components in units of volume instead    
  of length (volume per unit area).  As such, the area is unimportant for       
  determining the heads on liners or the apportionment of rainfall to the       
  water balance components as a percent of the precipitation.  The user must    
  still define the other design parameters accurately even if the analysis is   
  being performed on a unit area basis.                                         
#AREA                                                                           
#RUNPERCENT                                                                     
                                                                                
       The third entry is for the percent of area where runoff is possible.     
  This variable specifies the portion of the area that is sloped in a manner    
  that would permit drainage off the surface.  The runoff estimates predicted   
  by the model are equal to the computed runoff by the curve number method      
  times this percent.  The difference between the computed runoff and the       
  actual runoff is added to the infiltration.                                   
#RUNPERCENT                                                                     
                                                                                
       Next, the user must select the method of moisture content                
  initialization; that is whether or not the user wishes to specify the         
  initial moisture storage.  If the user answers NO to this question, the       
  program assumes near steady-state values and then runs the first year of the  
  simulation to improve the initialization to steady-state.  The soil water     
  contents at the end of this year of initialization are taken as the initial   
  values for the simulation period.  The program then runs the complete         
  simulation, starting again at the beginning of the first year of weather      
  data.  The results for the initialization period are not reported.            
  However, if the user answers YES, the user is requested to enter the amount   
  of water or snow water on the surface in the units selected.  Later, the      
  user should enter the initial moisture content of each layer as explained in  
  the next section.                                                             
#INITIALSM                                                                      
                                                                                
  Soil Moisture Initialization                                                  
                                                                                
       The user must select the method of moisture content initialization;      
  that is whether or not the user wishes to specify the initial moisture        
  storage.  If the user answers NO to this question, the program assumes near   
  steady-state values and then runs the first year of the simulation to         
  improve the initialization to steady-state.  However, if the user answers     
  YES, the user is requested to enter the amount of water or snow water on the  
  surface in the units selected.                                                
                                                                                
       The soil moisture of the layers may be initialized by the user or the    
  program.  When initialized by the program, the process consists of three      
  steps.  The first step sets the soil moisture of all layers except barrier    
  soil liners equal to field capacity and all barrier soil liners to porosity   
  (saturation).  In the second step, the program computes a soil moisture for   
  each layer below the top barrier soil liner.  These soil moisture contents    
  are computed to yield an unsaturated hydraulic conductivity equal to 85       
  percent of the lowest effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of the all   
  liner systems above the layer, including consideration for the presence of a  
  synthetic geomembrane liner.  If the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is    
  less than 1 x 10-6 cm/sec and if the computed soil moisture is greater than   
  field capacity, the soil moisture is set to equal computed soil moisture      
  instead of the field capacity.  The third step in the initialization          
  consists of running the model for one year of simulation using the first      
  year of climate data and the initial soil moisture values selected in step    
  2.  At the end of this year of initialization, the soil moisture values       
  existing at that point are reported as the initial soil moisture values.      
  The simulation is then restarted using the first year of climate data.        
                                                                                
       The results for the initialization period are not reported.  To improve  
  initialization to steady-state moisture storage, the user should replace      
  thick vertical percolation and lateral drainage layers, that are below the    
  evaporative zone and above the saturated zone above liners, with thin         
  layers.  Then, run the simulation for a number of years until steady-state    
  is approximated.  The final dimensionless water storage values after nearing  
  steady-state should then be specified as the initial water contents in your   
  actual simulation using the true dimensions of the layers.                    
                                                                                
       The values for the initial moisture storage are placed in column 7 of    
  the first screen of layer spreadsheets.  The initial moisture content must    
  be greater than or equal to the wilting point and less than or equal to the   
  porosity.  If the user had indicated on the "Landfill General Information"    
  screen that the program should specify initial moisture content for the soil  
  layers, the program will ignore all input in column 7.  As such, the user     
  does not need to enter data in this column.  On the other hand, if the user   
  had indicated that the user wishes to specify the initial moisture content,   
  these values must be entered manually.  An empty cell is interpreted as zero  
  for initial moisture, violating the rules.  If the layer is a liner, the      
  program during execution automatically sets the initial water content equal   
  to the porosity of the layer.  The program will detect violations of these    
  values and will report them to the user during verifications when the data    
  is to be saved to a file.                                                     
                                                                                
       The soil water storage or content used in the HELP model is on a per     
  volume basis (THETA), volume of water (Vw) per total (bulk--soil, water and   
  air) soil volume (Vt = Vs + Vw + Va), which is characteristic of practice in  
  agronomy and soil physics.  Engineers more commonly express moisture content  
  on a per mass basis (w), mass of water (Mw) per mass of soil (Ms).  The two   
  can be related to each other by knowing the dry bulk density (RHOdb), dry     
  bulk specific gravity (GAMMAdb) of the soil (ratio of dry bulk density to     
  water density (RHOw), wet bulk density (RHOwb), wet bulk specific gravity     
  (GAMMAwb) of the soil (ratio of wet bulk density to water density.

  4.6.3  LANDFILL LAYER DATA                                                    
                                                                                
       The next step in the soil and design data module is to input the design  
  specifications of the landfill profile, one layer at a time.  Layer data are  
  entered in three screens.  These screens have a spreadsheet layout where      
  each row represents a layer.  Figure 15 shows the three spreadsheets and      
  their associated screens.  The first row of cells on the screens is the       
  uppermost layer in the landfill.  Each column of cells on the screens         
  represents a variable or a property of the layer or its material.  Variable   
  names are listed in the first two rows of the screen, and the third row       
  contains the units of that variable, if any.  Every highlighted cell is       
  associated with a highlighted property (heading of a column) and a            
  highlighted layer number (row label).  The user should enter the value of     
  the specified property for the corresponding layer.  All entries must obey    
  certain rules which are discussed below.                                      
                                                                                
       While the HELP program is quite flexible, there are some basic rules     
  that must be followed regarding the arrangement of layers in the profile.     
                                                                                
       1.  A vertical percolation layer may not be underlying a lateral         
           drainage layer.                                                      
                                                                                
       2.  A barrier soil liner may not be underlying another barrier soil      
           liner.                                                               
                                                                                
       3.  A geomembrane liner may not be placed directly between two barrier   
           soil liners.                                                         
                                                                                
       4.  A geomembrane liner may not be underlying another geomembrane        
           liner.                                                               
                                                                                
       5.  A barrier soil liner may not be placed directly between two          
           geomembrane liners.                                                  
                                                                                
       6.  When a barrier soil liner or a geomembrane liner is not placed       
           directly below the lowest drainage layer, all drainage layers below  
           the lowest liner are treated as vertical percolation layers.  Thus,  
           no lateral drainage is computed for the bottom section of the        
           landfill.                                                            
                                                                                
       7.  The top layer may not be a barrier soil liner.                       
                                                                                
       8.  The top layer may not be a geomembrane liner.                        
                                                                                
       9.  The profile can contain no more than a total of five barrier soil    
           liners and geomembrane liners.                                       
                                                                                
       Although the program checks for rule violations, it does so only at the  
  time the user decides to save the data.  Therefore, to reduce the time        
  involved in evaluating a landfill, the user is encouraged to construct a      
  proper layer arrangement before saving the data.                              
                                                                                
       The second screen of layer spreadsheets can be obtained by pressing      
  Page Down.  On this sheet the user will notice that the layer type is         
  already appearing.  In the first column of cells the saturated hydraulic      
  conductivity must be specified in the appropriate  units (cm/sec).  If the    
  soil texture selected was a default soil/material texture or a user-defined   
  soil texture, the saturated hydraulic conductivity will be displayed in this  
  column.  Remember that changing the saturated hydraulic conductivity causes   
  the soil texture number on the previous screen to revert to zero in the same  
  manner as changing any of the other material characteristics (porosity,       
  field capacity or wilting point).                                             
                                                                                
  Drainage Layer Design                                                         
                                                                                
       Information on lateral drainage layer design must be entered manually    
  for each lateral drainage layer directly above the liner regardless of the    
  method used to enter soil textures.  The required information is the          
  drainage length, drainage layer slope, recirculation percentage and           
  recirculation destination.  These parameters are found in the second through  
  fifth column of cells on the second spreadsheet screen of layer data.  These  
  columns are used only for the lateral drainage layers directly above the      
  liner; data placed in rows for other layers will be ignored during            
  execution.                                                                    
                                                                                
       After entering the necessary values in the second spreadsheet screen of  
  layer data, the user should press Page Down to go to the third and last       
  screen of layer data.  Pressing Page Up will return to the first spreadsheet  
  of layer data, allowing the user to edit the previously entered values.       
  Again, on the third spreadsheet screen, the layer type of all layers in the   
  profile are displayed to aid in positioning data on the screen.               
                                                                                
  Geomembrane Liner Design                                                      
                                                                                
       All of the entries on third screen of layer data pertain to geomembrane  
  liner properties such as geomembrane liner pinhole density, geomembrane       
  liner installation defect density, geomembrane liner placement quality, and   
  associated geotextile transmissivity (if present).  Values must be entered    
  for each geomembrane liner (layer type 4) in the profile.  Guidance on        
  estimating the pinhole and installation defect density as well as             
  definitions for these parameters is provided in Section 3.  The placement     
  quality options are also described in Section 3 and are presented below.      
  The geotextile transmissivity should be specified only when a placement       
  quality of 6 is used.                                                         
                                                                                
       After completing input for one layer, the user can go back to the first  
  spreadsheet and enter information for other layers.  Page Up and Page Down    
  are used to move backward and forward between spreadsheets.  The user may     
  also input values on one spreadsheet completely filling it, and move on to    
  the next spreadsheet filling in the information for the layers entered in     
  the first spreadsheet and so on.  It is advisable that no blank rows be left  
  in the spreadsheet between layers; however, if the user does leave some       
  blank lines, the program will not save these as layers.                       
                                                                                
  Layer Editing                                                                 
                                                                                
       While entering or editing the properties of the layers in the landfill   
  defined in the three spreadsheets of layer data, the user has the option to   
  add a layer to the profile, delete a layer, move a layer to another location  
  in the profile, or copy a layer to another location.  When using these layer  
  editing functions, the program operates simultaneously on all three screens   
  of layer data.  This is done by using the following key combinations:         
                                                                                
       Alt A  adds/inserts a layer (either new, being moved or being copied)    
              above the highlighted layer (where the cursor is positioned)      
                                                                                
       Alt B  adds/inserts a layer (either new, being moved or being copied)    
              below the highlighted layer (where the cursor is positioned)      
                                                                                
       Alt D  deletes the highlighted layer (where the cursor is positioned)    
                                                                                
       Alt M  tags the highlighted layer (where the cursor is positioned) to    
              be moved to another location to be designated using the cursor    
              and Alt A or Alt B                                                
                                                                                
       Alt C  tags the highlighted layer (where the cursor is positioned) to    
              be copied to another location to be designated using the cursor   
              and Alt A or Alt B                                                
                                                                                
       To add a new layer directly above a certain layer, for example above     
  the layer on line 6 (shown on the left edge of the screen), the user should   
  move the cursor to line 6, hold the Alt key down, and press A.  The result    
  of this action is that a blank line is inserted above the layer that was at   
  line 6, and the program shifts the layer on line 6 and all the layers below   
  it one line downward (i.e. layer on line 6 moves to line 7, layer on line 7   
  moves to line 8, etc.), and line 6 will be a blank line for the user to       
  enter the values for the new layer.                                           
                                                                                
       To add a layer right below a certain layer, for example below the layer  
  on line 5, the user should move the cursor to line 5, hold the Alt key down,  
  and press B.  The result of this action is that a blank line is inserted      
  below line 5, and the program shifts the layer on line 6 and all the layers   
  below it one line downward (i.e. layer on line 6 moves to line 7, layer on    
  line 7 moves to line 8, etc.), and line 6 will be a blank cell for the user   
  to enter the value of the new layer.                                          
                                                                                
       The Alt D combination causes the program to delete a layer from the      
  list of layers.  As an example, to delete the layer on line 3, the user       
  should move the cursor to line 3, hold the Alt key down, and press D.  The    
  program will delete all information on line 3 and will shift the layers on    
  lines 4 to 20 upward one line (i.e. layer on line 4 moves to line 3, layer    
  on line 5 moves to line 4, etc.), and line 20 becomes a blank line.  The      
  user is cautioned that the deleted layer cannot be recovered without          
  quitting and losing all changes (F9 or Esc).                                  
                                                                                
       The copy command allows the user to place a layer that is identical to   
  another layer on another line.  For example, to copy the layer on line 7 to   
  line 2, move the cursor to line 7 and press the Alt C combination, then move  
  the cursor to line 2 and press the Alt A combination.  This action will       
  cause the program to insert a layer with values the same as those formerly    
  found at line 7 above the layer formerly found at line 2.  The layers         
  formerly at and below line 2 will be moved downward one line.  (The user may  
  obtain the same result after the Alt C combination by moving to line 1 and    
  pressing the combination Alt B).                                              
                                                                                
       The move command allows the user to move a layer from one row on the     
  screens of layer data to another row.  For example, to move the layer on      
  line 3 above the layer on line 6, move the cursor to line 3, press the Alt M  
  combination, and move the cursor to line 6 and press the Alt A combination.   
  This action will cause the layer on line 3 to be deleted and be placed        
  directly above the layer on line 6.  This will cause line 4 to move up one    
  line to line 3, line 5 to move to line 4 and line 3 to move to line 5; the    
  other lines will be unchanged.  (The user may obtain the same result after    
  the Alt M combination by moving to line 5 and pressing the combination Alt    
  B).                                                                           
                                                                                
       The Esc key can be used to quit the move and copy functions (after       
  pressing Alt M or Alt C and before pressing Alt A or Alt B).  By editing the  
  data as discussed above, the user may arrange the order of the layers and     
  run the model to test several possible configurations.                        
                                                                                
       If the user has 20 lines completely filled with layers and then decides  
  to add or copy a layer, the layer that is already in line 20 will disappear   
  and can not be recovered.  Therefore, care must be taken not to add layers    
  that will cause the loss of the layers at the bottom of the spreadsheet.      
                                                                                
       When all the profile's layers are entered, press Page Down from the      
  third layer spreadsheet to proceed with the rest of the soil and design data  
  entry.  If Page Up is pressed from the first layer spreadsheet, control       
  returns to the "Landfill General Information" screen.                         
                                                                                
#LAYERS                                                                         
#LAYERTYPE                                                                      
                                                                                
  Layer Type                                                                    
                                                                                
       The user should input layer type in the first column of the              
  spreadsheet.  The four layer types and their associated code numbers that     
  the program recognizes are vertical percolation (1), lateral drainage (2),    
  barrier soil liner (3), and geomembrane liner (4).  These are defined as      
  follows:                                                                      
                                                                                
       1.  A layer of moderate to high permeability material that drains        
           vertically primarily as unsaturated flow is classified as a          
           vertical percolation layer as long as it is not underlain by a       
           liner with a lateral drainage collection and removal system.  Its    
           primary purpose is to provide moisture storage; as such, top soil    
           layers and waste layers are often vertical percolation layers.       
                                                                                
       2.  A layer of moderate to high permeability material that is underlain  
           by a liner with a lateral drainage collection and removal system is  
           classified as a lateral drainage layer.  The layer drains            
           vertically primarily as unsaturated flow and laterally as a          
           saturated flow.                                                      
                                                                                
       3.  A layer of low permeability soil designed to limit percolation/      
           leakage is classified as a barrier soil liner.  The layer drains     
           only vertically as a saturated flow.                                 
                                                                                
       4.  A geomembrane (synthetic flexible membrane liner) designed to        
           restrict vertical drainage and limit leakage is classified as a      
           geomembrane liner.  Leakage is modeled as vapor diffusion and        
           leakage through small manufacturing defects and installation flaws.  
                                                                                
                                                                                
       Flow in a vertical percolation layer (e.g., Layers 1 and 5 in Figure 1)  
  is by unsaturated vertical drainage downward due to gravity drainage; upward  
  flux due to evapotranspiration is modeled as an extraction.  The rate of      
  gravity drainage (percolation) in a vertical percolation layer is a function  
  of soil moisture and soil texture data.  The saturated hydraulic              
  conductivity specified for a vertical percolation layer should be in the      
  vertical direction for anisotropic materials.  The main role of a vertical    
  percolation layer is to provide moisture storage.  Waste layers and layers    
  designed to support vegetation and provide evaporative storage are normally   
  designated as vertical percolation layers.                                    
                                                                                
       Lateral drainage layers (e.g., Layers 2, 6, 7 and 9 in Figure 1) are     
  layers directly above liners that are designed to promote drainage laterally  
  to a collection and removal system.  Vertical flow in a lateral drainage      
  layer is modeled in the same manner as a vertical percolation layer, but      
  saturated lateral drainage is allowed.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity  
  specified for a lateral drainage layer should be in the lateral direction     
  (downslope) for anisotropic materials.  A lateral drainage layer may be       
  underlain by only another lateral drainage layer or a liner.  The drainage    
  slope specified for a lateral drainage should be the slope of the surface of  
  the liner underlying the drainage layer in the direction of flow (the         
  maximum gradient for a section of liner in a single plane) and may range      
  from 0 to 50 percent.  The drainage length specified for a lateral drainage   
  layer is the length of the horizontal projection of a representative flow     
  path from the crest to the collector rather than the distance along the       
  slope.  For slopes of less than ten percent, the difference is negligible.    
  The drainage length must be greater than zero but does not have a practical   
  upper limit.  Recirculation is permitted from lateral drainage layers         
  directly above a liner where 0 to 100 percent of the drainage collected can   
  be recirculated and redistributed in a user-specified vertical percolation    
  or lateral drainage layer.                                                    
                                                                                
       Barrier soil liners (e.g., Layers 4, and 11 in Figure 1) are intended    
  to restrict vertical drainage (percolation/leakage).  These layers should     
  have saturated hydraulic conductivities substantially lower than those of     
  the other types of layers.  Liners are assumed to be saturated at all times   
  but leak only when there is a positive head on the top surface of the liner.  
  The percolation rate depends upon the depth of water-saturated soil (head)    
  above the base of the liner, the thickness of the liner and the saturated     
  hydraulic conductivity.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity specified for   
  a barrier soil liner should be its value for passing the expected permeant    
  in the vertical direction for anisotropic materials.  The program allows      
  only downward saturated flow in barrier soil liners.  Evapotranspiration and  
  lateral drainage are not permitted from a liner.  Thus, any water moving      
  into a liner will eventually percolate through.  In Version 3 composite       
  liners are modeled as two layers -- a geomembrane liner and a barrier soil    
  liner as shown in Figure 1.                                                   
                                                                                
       Geomembrane liners (e.g., Layers 3, 8 and 10 in Figure 1) are virtually  
  impermeable synthetic membranes that reduces the area of vertical             
  drainage/percolation/leakage to a very small fraction of the area located     
  near manufacturing flaws and installation defects (punctures, tears and       
  faulty seaming).  Some small quantity of vapor transport across the membrane  
  occurs and is modeled by specifying the vapor diffusivity as the saturated    
  hydraulic conductivity of the geomembrane.  Geomembranes leak only when       
  there is a positive head on the top surface of the liner.  The leakage rate   
  depends on the depth of saturated soil (head) above the liner, the saturated  
  hydraulic conductivity of the drainage limiting soil layer adjacent to the    
  membrane, the contact between the membrane and the adjacent drainage          
  limiting soil layer, geomembrane properties and the size and number of holes  
  in the geomembrane liner.  Aging of geomembranes is not considered.           
                                                                                
       While the HELP program is quite flexible, there are some basic rules     
  that must be followed regarding the arrangement of layers in the profile.     
                                                                                
       1.  A vertical percolation layer may not be underlying a lateral         
           drainage layer.                                                      
                                                                                
       2.  A barrier soil liner may not be underlying another barrier soil      
           liner.                                                               
                                                                                
       3.  A geomembrane liner may not be placed directly between two barrier   
           soil liners.                                                         
                                                                                
       4.  A geomembrane liner may not be underlying another geomembrane        
           liner.                                                               
                                                                                
       5.  A barrier soil liner may not be placed directly between two          
           geomembrane liners.                                                  
                                                                                
       6.  When a barrier soil liner or a geomembrane liner is not placed       
           directly below the lowest drainage layer, all drainage layers below  
           the lowest liner are treated as vertical percolation layers.  Thus,  
           no lateral drainage is computed for the bottom section of the        
           landfill.                                                            
                                                                                
       7.  The top layer may not be a barrier soil liner.                       
                                                                                
       8.  The top layer may not be a geomembrane liner.                        
                                                                                
       9.  The profile can contain no more than a total of five barrier soil    
           liners and geomembrane liners.                                       
                                                                                
       Although the program checks for rule violations, it does so only at the  
  time the user decides to save the data.  Therefore, to reduce the time        
  involved in evaluating a landfill, the user is encouraged to construct a      
  proper layer arrangement before saving the data.                              
                                                                                
       The HELP model does not permit two barrier soil liners to be adjacent    
  to each other.  If your design has two soil layers adjacent to each other     
  that would be expected to act as a single liner and both soils will remain    
  nearly saturated and contribute significantly to the head loss and            
  restriction of vertical drainage, then the thickness of the two layers        
  should be summed and an effective saturated hydraulic conductivity should be  
  computed for the combined liner.  The effective saturated hydraulic           
  conductivity should be computed as follows:                                   
                                                                                
                         Te                     sum of Ti for i = 1 to n        
     Ke  =  -----------------------------  =  -----------------------------     
             sum of Ti/Ki for i = 1 to n       sum of Ti/Ki for i = 1 to n      
                                                                                
  where                                                                         
        Ke  =  effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of combined liner     
        Te  =  effective thickness of combined liner                            
        Ki  =  saturated hydraulic conductivity of liner soil i                 
        Ti  =  thickness of liner soil i                                        
        n   =  number of liner soils in the combined liner                      
                                                                                
       For computational purposes, the soil profile is partitioned into         
  subprofiles.  Subprofiles are defined in relation to the location of the      
  liners.  The first (top) subprofile shown on Figure 1 extends from the        
  landfill surface to the bottom of the highest liner system (bottom of the     
  composite liner, Layer 4) upper barrier soil layer.  The second subprofile    
  extends from the top of the layer (Layer 5) below the bottom of the first     
  liner system to the base of the second liner system (Layer 8).  The third     
  (bottom) subprofile extends from the top of the layer below the second liner  
  system (the leakage detection drainage layer, Layer 9) to the base of the     
  lowest liner (Layer 11).  The program allows up to five liner systems and     
  therefore five subprofiles plus an additional subprofile of vertical          
  percolation layers below the bottom liner system.  The program models the     
  flow of water through one subprofile at a time from top to bottom, with the   
  percolation or leakage from one subprofile serving as the inflow to the       
  underlying subprofile.                                                        
                                                                                
#LAYERTYPE                                                                      
#THICKNESS                                                                      
                                                                                
       In the second column, which has the heading "Layer Thickness", the user  
  should enter the thickness of each layer in the landfill profile even for     
  the geomembrane liner, in inches or cm.  The values must be greater than      
  zero; a blank cell is taken as a value of zero.  Again, during data           
  verification the program checks for layer thickness of zero and issues a      
  violation statement when the user tries to save the data.                     
                                                                                
#THICKNESS                                                                      
#TEXTURE                                                                        
                                                                                
       In the third column, the user should enter the soil texture number of    
  the soil that forms the layer.  The 4 possible options for the user to enter  
  soil texture numbers are:                                                     
                                                                                
       1.  Select from a list of default textures for 42 soils, wastes,         
           geomembranes, geosynthetics and other materials                      
                                                                                
       2.  Select from a library of user defined textures that were previously  
           saved and numbered by the user (up to 100 such textures are          
           allowed)                                                             
                                                                                
       3.  Enter a new soil texture number that can be used again in this       
           design and that can later be saved in the library of user defined    
           textures (material properties must also be entered manually for      
           this texture)                                                        
                                                                                
       4.  Leave the texture number blank and enter the material                
           properties manually                                                  
                                                                                
  Default Soil/Material Textures                                                
                                                                                
       Default soil/material textures have numbers from 1 to 42 and are listed  
  in Table 4.  The user can either type the soil texture number or press F6 to  
  select a texture from the list of default textures.  If the user enters a     
  default soil/material texture number manually, the program automatically      
  assigns the default values for porosity, field capacity, wilting point, and   
  hydraulic conductivity to the layer.  On the other hand, the user may press   
  F6 to obtain the list of soil textures on a separate screen.  On this screen  
  the user can move the cursor to the desired soil texture or press Page Down   
  to display the rest of the default soil textures.  After cursoring to the     
  desired texture, press Enter to select it.  At this time, program control     
  returns to layer spreadsheet screen and displays the selected soil texture    
  number, along with the porosity, field capacity, wilting point, and           
  hydraulic conductivity in appropriate cells.  Notice that the only            
  information available for the default geomembrane liners is the hydraulic     
  conductivity (liner vapor diffusivity).  It should be noted that if the user  
  changes any of the four soil properties just obtained for a default           
  soil/material texture, the program automatically resets the soil texture      
  number to 0.  The user can then give it a new number that is not used in      
  either the list of default or previously saved user defined textures if the   
  user wishes to save the material characteristics for future use.              
                                                                                
       The default soil textures are classified according to two standard       
  systems -- the U.S.  Department of Agriculture classification system and the  
  Unified Soil Classification System.  The default characteristics of textures  
  1 through 15 are typical of surficial and disturbed agricultural soils,       
  which may be less consolidated and more aerated than soils typically placed   
  in landfills (Rawls et al., 1982; Breazeale and McGeorge, 1949; England,      
  1970; Lutton et al., 1979).  Clays and silts in landfills would generally be  
  compacted except within the vegetative layer, which might be tilled to        
  promote vegetative growth.  Untilled vegetative layers may be more compacted  
  than the loams listed in Table 4.  Soil textures 22 through 29 are compacted  
  soils.  Soil texture type 18 is representative of typical municipal solid     
  waste that has been compacted.  Soil texture types 16 and 17 denote very      
  well compacted clay soils that might be used for barrier soil liners.  The    
  user assigns default soil characteristics to a layer simply by specifying     
  the appropriate soil texture number.  The user-defined soil option accepts    
  non-default soil characteristics for layers assigned soil textures greater    
  than 42.  This is especially convenient for specifying characteristics of     
  waste layers.  User-specified soil characteristics can be assigned any soil   
  textures greater than 42.                                                     
                                                                                
       When a default soil texture is used to describe the top soil layer, the  
  program adjusts the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the soils in the    
  top half of the evaporative zone for the effects of root channels.  The       
  saturated hydraulic conductivity value is multiplied by an empirical factor   
  that is computed as a function of the user-specified maximum leaf area        
  index.  Example values of this factor are 1.0 for a maximum LAI of 0 (bare    
  ground), 1.8 for a maximum LAI of 1 (poor stand of grass), 3.0 for a maximum  
  LAI of 2 (fair stand of grass), 4.2 for a maximum LAI of 3.3 (good stand of   
  grass) and 5.0 for a maximum LAI of 5 (excellent stand of grass).             
                                                                                
       As mentioned above, default soil/material textures are obtained by       
  pressing F6 and are available on all three screens.  To move from one screen  
  of default soil/material textures to another the user should press Page Up    
  or Page Down.  To return to the layer spreadsheet without making a            
  selection, press Esc.  A selection is made only by moving the cursor to the   
  desired soil texture and pressing Enter.                                      
                                                                                
  User-Defined Soil Texture                                                     
                                                                                
       In Version 3 of the HELP model, in addition to selecting soil textures   
  from the default list, the user has three additional options to specify       
  material characteristics.  One method is to enter the all of the material     
  characteristics manually without specifying a soil texture number.  This      
  method is used when the user does not wish to save these characteristics for  
  use again in this simulation or future simulations.  The second method is     
  the same as the first except that a new texture number is assigned to the     
  soil texture number.  This method is used when the same characteristics are   
  to be used in future simulations and the characteristics are to be            
  permanently saved in a library of user-defined textures.  A library of up to  
  100 soil textures may be saved in a "user-defined soil texture" data file.    
  The creation and addition of textures to this file are explained in a later   
  section of this User's Guide.  The third method is select a user-defined      
  texture that were previously saved in the library.  If this library of user-  
  defined soil textures exists, the user can select a texture from this list    
  for a given layer by pressing F7.  The selection process is identical to      
  that of the selection of default soil/material textures.  The user should     
  move the cursor to the desired soil texture and press Enter to select a       
  user-defined soil texture.  At this point program control returns to the      
  layer spreadsheet and displays soil texture values, porosity, field           
  capacity, wilting point, and hydraulic conductivity of the selected soil.     
  Also, in the same manner as in default soil/material textures, the user can   
  simply type the number of the user-defined soil texture in "Soil Texture      
  No." column of the first screen of the layer spreadsheets, and the program    
  will automatically obtain the soil characteristics for that soil texture and  
  place them in the proper location on the layer spreadsheet.                   
                                                                                
       Whenever F7 is pressed, control transfers to the user-defined soil       
  textures.  To move among pages of soil textures press Page Up and Page Down.  
  To make a selection, press Enter, and to return to the layer spreadsheet      
  without making a selection, press Esc.                                        
                                                                                
#TEXTURE                                                                        
#RETENTION                                                                      
                                                                                
       The manual soil texture option requires values for total porosity,       
  field capacity, wilting point, and saturated hydraulic conductivity.  These   
  and related soil properties are defined below.                                
                                                                                
       Soil Moisture Storage (Content):  the ratio of the volume of water in    
           a soil to the total volume occupied by the soil, water and voids.    
                                                                                
       Total Porosity:  the soil moisture storage/content at saturation.        
                                                                                
       Field Capacity:  the soil moisture storage/content after a prolonged     
           period of gravity drainage from saturation corresponding to the      
           soil water storage when a soil exerts a soil suction of 1/3 bar.     
                                                                                
       Wilting Point:  the lowest soil moisture storage/content that can be     
           achieved by plant transpiration or air-drying, that is the moisture  
           content where a plant will be permanently wilted corresponding to    
           the soil water storage when a soil exerts a soil suction of 15       
           bars.                                                                
                                                                                
       Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  the rate at which water drains        
           through a saturated soil under a unit pressure gradient.             
                                                                                
  Porosity, field capacity and wilting point are all dimensionless numbers      
  between 0 and 1.  Porosity must be greater than field capacity, which         
  in turn must be greater than the wilting point.  The wilting point must be    
  greater than zero.  The values for porosity, field capacity and wilting       
  point are not used for liners, except for initializing the soil water         
  storage of liners to the porosity value.  Values for porosity, field          
  capacity and wilting point are not needed for geomembranes.                   
                                                                                
       The values entered for the moisture storage parameters in columns 4      
  through 7 of the first screen of layer spreadsheets are interrelated.  In     
  column 4 the porosity must be greater than zero but less than 1.  In column   
  5 the field capacity must be between zero and 1 but must be smaller than the  
  porosity.  In column 6 the wilting point must be greater than zero but less   
  than the field capacity.                                                      
                                                                                
       In column 7 the initial moisture content must be greater than or equal   
  to the wilting point and less than or equal to the porosity.  If the user     
  had indicated on the "Landfill General Information" screen that the program   
  should specify initial moisture content for the soil layers, the program      
  will ignore all input in column 7.  As such, the user does not need to enter  
  data in this column.  On the other hand, if the user had indicated that the   
  user wishes to specify the initial moisture content, these values must be     
  entered manually.  An empty cell is interpreted as zero for initial           
  moisture, violating the rules.  If the layer is a liner, the program during   
  execution automatically sets the initial water content equal to the porosity  
  of the layer.  The program will detect violations of these values and will    
  report them to the user during verifications when the data is to be saved to  
  a file.                                                                       
                                                                                
       The soil moisture retention properties of a layer should be adjusted     
  downward if some volume of the layer does not participate in the drainage     
  and storage of infiltrated water.  This condition commonly exists in layers   
  of municipal solid waste because municipal solid waste is very heterogeneous. 
  The plastics in the waste also channels the drainage, limits the spreading    
  of infiltration, and restricts the wetting of the waste and, therefore, the   
  storage.  Default soil texture number provides adjusted retention values for  
  a municipal solid waste with significant channeling; it assumes that only     
  25 percent of the volume is actively involved in drainage and storage.  As    
  the values were computed by multiplying the values for municipal solid        
  waste (default testure number 18) by 0.25; the initial soil water content     
  would also be multiply by 0.25.                                               
                                                                                
       The initial moisture content of municipal solid waste is a function of   
  the composition of the waste; reported values for fresh wastes range from     
  about 0.08 to 0.20 vol/vol.  The average value is about 0.12 vol/vol for      
  compacted municipal solid waste.  If using default waste texture 19, where    
  75% of the volume is inactive, the initial moisture content should that of    
  only the active portion, 25% of the values reported above.                    
                                                                                
       The soil water storage or content used in the HELP model is on a per     
  volume basis (THETA), volume of water (Vw) per total (bulk--soil, water and   
  air) soil volume (Vt = Vs + Vw + Va), which is characteristic of practice in  
  agronomy and soil physics.  Engineers more commonly express moisture content  
  on a per mass basis (w), mass of water (Mw) per mass of soil (Ms).  The two   
  can be related to each other by knowing the dry bulk density (RHOdb), dry     
  bulk specific gravity (GAMMAdb) of the soil (ratio of dry bulk density to     
  water density (RHOw), wet bulk density (RHOwb), wet bulk specific gravity     
  (GAMMAwb) of the soil (ratio of wet bulk density to water density.            
                                                                                
                                    RHOdb

#RETENTION                                                                      
#CONDUCTIVITY                                                                   
                                                                                
       When a default soil texture is used to describe the top soil layer, the  
  program adjusts the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the soils in the    
  top half of the evaporative zone for the effects of root channels.  The       
  saturated hydraulic conductivity value is multiplied by an empirical factor   
  that is computed as a function of the user-specified maximum leaf area        
  index.  Example values of this factor are 1.0 for a maximum LAI of 0 (bare    
  ground), 1.8 for a maximum LAI of 1 (poor stand of grass), 3.0 for a maximum  
  LAI of 2 (fair stand of grass), 4.2 for a maximum LAI of 3.3 (good stand of   
  grass) and 5.0 for a maximum LAI of 5 (excellent stand of grass).  When       
  specifying the value manually, the value should be the field value and it     
  should include the effects of vegetation, macropores, compaction and any      
  other factor that may affect the rate that water may move through the layer.  
                                                                                
       Flow in a vertical percolation layer (e.g., Layers 1 and 5 in Figure 1)  
  is by unsaturated vertical drainage downward due to gravity drainage; upward  
  flux due to evapotranspiration is modeled as an extraction.  The rate of      
  gravity drainage (percolation) in a vertical percolation layer is a function  
  of soil moisture and soil texture data.  The saturated hydraulic              
  conductivity specified for a vertical percolation layer should be in the      
  vertical direction for anisotropic materials.  The main role of a vertical    
  percolation layer is to provide moisture storage.  Waste layers and layers    
  designed to support vegetation and provide evaporative storage are normally   
  designated as vertical percolation layers.                                    
#DRAIN                                                                          
                                                                                
       Lateral drainage layers (e.g., Layers 2, 6, 7 and 9 in Figure 1) are     
  layers directly above liners that are designed to promote drainage laterally  
  to a collection and removal system.  Vertical flow in a lateral drainage      
  layer is modeled in the same manner as a vertical percolation layer, but      
  saturated lateral drainage is allowed.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity  
  specified for a lateral drainage layer should be in the lateral direction     
  (downslope) for anisotropic materials.  A lateral drainage layer may be       
  underlain by only another lateral drainage layer or a liner.  The drainage    
  slope specified for a lateral drainage should be the slope of the surface of  
  the liner underlying the drainage layer in the direction of flow (the         
  maximum gradient for a section of liner in a single plane) and may range      
  from 0 to 50 percent.  The drainage length specified for a lateral drainage   
  layer is the length of the horizontal projection of a representative flow     
  path from the crest to the collector rather than the distance along the       
  slope.  For slopes of less than ten percent, the difference is negligible.    
  The drainage length must be greater than zero but does not have a practical   
  upper limit.  Recirculation is permitted from lateral drainage layers         
  directly above a liner where 0 to 100 percent of the drainage collected can   
  be recirculated and redistributed in a user-specified vertical percolation    
  or lateral drainage layer.                                                    
#DRAIN                                                                          
                                                                                
       Barrier soil liners (e.g., Layers 4, and 11 in Figure 1) are intended    
  to restrict vertical drainage (percolation/leakage).  These layers should     
  have saturated hydraulic conductivities substantially lower than those of     
  the other types of layers.  Liners are assumed to be saturated at all times   
  but leak only when there is a positive head on the top surface of the liner.  
  The percolation rate depends upon the depth of water-saturated soil (head)    
  above the base of the liner, the thickness of the liner and the saturated     
  hydraulic conductivity.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity specified for   
  a barrier soil liner should be its value for passing the expected permeant    
  in the vertical direction for anisotropic materials.  The program allows      
  only downward saturated flow in barrier soil liners.  Evapotranspiration and  
  lateral drainage are not permitted from a liner.  Thus, any water moving      
  into a liner will eventually percolate through.  In Version 3 composite       
  liners are modeled as two layers -- a geomembrane liner and a barrier soil    
  liner as shown in Figure 1.                                                   
                                                                                
       Geomembrane liners (e.g., Layers 3, 8 and 10 in Figure 1) are virtually  
  impermeable synthetic membranes that reduces the area of vertical             
  drainage/percolation/leakage to a very small fraction of the area located     
  near manufacturing flaws and installation defects (punctures, tears and       
  faulty seaming).  Some small quantity of vapor transport across the membrane  
  occurs and is modeled by specifying the vapor diffusivity as the saturated    
  hydraulic conductivity of the geomembrane.  Geomembranes leak only when       
  there is a positive head on the top surface of the liner.  The leakage rate   
  depends on the depth of saturated soil (head) above the liner, the saturated  
  hydraulic conductivity of the drainage limiting soil layer adjacent to the    
  membrane, the contact between the membrane and the adjacent drainage          
  limiting soil layer, geomembrane properties and the size and number of holes  
  in the geomembrane liner.  Aging of geomembranes is not considered.           
                                                                                
       The HELP model does not permit two barrier soil liners to be adjacent    
  to each other.  If your design has two soil layers adjacent to each other     
  that would be expected to act as a single liner and both soils will remain    
  nearly saturated and contribute significantly to the head loss and            
  restriction of vertical drainage, then the thickness of the two layers        
  should be summed and an effective saturated hydraulic conductivity should be  
  computed for the combined liner.  The effective saturated hydraulic           
  conductivity should be computed as follows:

  where                                                                         
        Ke  =  effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of combined liner     
        Te  =  effective thickness of combined liner

       In Version 3, the HELP program allows leachate/drainage recirculation    
  to be simulated.  The amount of leachate/lateral drainage to be recirculated  
  from a given layer should be entered as a percent of the layer's drainage in  
  fourth column of cells.  The layer to which this leachate drainage should be  
  recirculated should be given in fifth column of cells.  This value entered    
  is number of the layer receiving the recirculation.  Layer numbers are those  
  numbers that are always displayed in the left-hand side of the screen.        
  These numbers are 1 through 20 and refer to the order of the layers in the    
  profile.  The HELP model does not allow leachate recirculation to a liner.

       Version 3 of the HELP model also allows the user to specify subsurface   
  inflow into the landfill from a groundwater source.  The amount of            
  subsurface inflow into each layer should be entered in the last column of     
  the second spreadsheet of layer data and is considered to be a steady flow    
  rate into the landfill at the layer where the inflow value is entered.  The   
  value entered should be equal to the volume seeping into a layer in a year    
  divided by the area of the landfill.  This could be calculated by Darcy's     
  law.  If subsurface inflow is specified for the bottom layer, the program     
  will assume no leakage out of the bottom of the landfill.  For most           
  landfills, the inflows will be zero and this column can be left blank.

  Geomembrane Liner Design                                                      
                                                                                
       All of the entries on third screen of layer data pertain to geomembrane  
  liner properties such as geomembrane liner pinhole density, geomembrane       
  liner installation defect density, geomembrane liner placement quality, and   
  associated geotextile transmissivity (if present).  Values must be entered    
  for each geomembrane liner (layer type 4) in the profile.  Guidance on        
  estimating the pinhole and installation defect density as well as             
  definitions for these parameters is provided in Section 3.  The placement     
  quality options are also described in Section 3 and are presented below.      
  The geotextile transmissivity should be specified only when a placement       
  quality of 6 is used.                                                         
                                                                                
       Regardless of the method of specifying the geomembrane "soil"            
  characteristics, the program also requires values for geomembrane liner       
  thickness, pinhole density, installation defect density, geomembrane          
  placement quality and the transmissivity of geotextiles separating            
  geomembranes and drainage limiting soils.  Some of these parameters are       
  defined below.                                                                
                                                                                
       Pinhole Density:  the number of defects (diameter of hole equal to       
           or smaller than the geomembrane thickness; hole estimated as 1 mm    
           in diameter) in a given area generally resulting from manufacturing  
           flaws such as polymerization deficiencies.                           
                                                                                
       Installation Defect Density:  the number of defects (diameter of hole    
           larger than the geomembrane thickness; hole estimated as 1 cm2 in    
           area) per acre resulting primarily from seaming faults and           
           punctures during installation.                                       
                                                                                
       Geotextile Transmissivity:  the product of the in-plane saturated        
           hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the geotextile.              
                                                                                
       The density of pinholes and installation defects is a subject of         
  speculation.  Ideally, geomembranes would not have any defects.  If any were  
  known to exist during construction, the defects would be repaired.  However,  
  geomembranes are known to leak and therefore reasonably conservative          
  estimates of the defect densities should be specified to determine the        
  maximum probable leakage quantities.                                          
                                                                                
       The density of defects have been measured at a number of landfills and   
  other facilities and reported in the literature.  These findings provide      
  guidance for estimating the defect densities.  Typical geomembranes may have  
  about 0.5 to 1 pinholes per acre (1 to 2 pinholes per hectare) from           
  manufacturing defects.  The density of installation defects is a function of  
  the quality of installation, testing, materials, surface preparation,         
  equipment, and QA/QC program.  Representative installation defect densities   
  as a function of the quality of installation are given below for landfills    
  being built today with the state-of-the-art in materials, equipment and       
  QA/QC.  The estimates are based on limited data but are characteristic of     
  the recommendations provided in the literature.

       * Higher defect densities have been reported for older landfills with

       The user is expected to enter placement quality of the geomembrane       
  liner in the third column of cells if pinholes or installation defects are    
  reported.  There are six different possible entries for the geomembrane       
  liner placement quality.  The program selects which equation will be used to  
  compute the geomembrane based on the placement quality specified and the      
  saturated hydraulic conductivity of the lower permeability soil (drainage     
  limiting soil) adjacent to the geomembrane.  The program has different        
  equations for three ranges of saturated hydraulic conductivity:  greater      
  than or equal to 0.1 cm/sec; less than 0.1 and greater than or equal to       
  0.0001 cm/sec; and less than 0.0001 cm/sec.                                   
                                                                                
       1.  Perfect:  Assumes perfect contact between geomembrane and adjacent   
              soil that limits drainage rate (no gap, "sprayed-on" seal         
              between membrane and soil formed in place).                       
                                                                                
       2.  Excellent:  Assumes exceptional contact between geomembrane and      
              adjacent soil that limits drainage rate (typically achievable     
              only in the lab or small field lysimeters).                       
                                                                                
       3.  Good:  Assumes good field installation with well-prepared, smooth    
              soil surface and geomembrane wrinkle control to insure good       
              contact between geomembrane and adjacent soil that limits         
              drainage rate.                                                    
                                                                                
       4.  Poor:  Assumes poor field installation with a less well-prepared     
              soil surface and/or geomembrane wrinkling providing poor contact  
              between geomembrane and adjacent soil that limits drainage rate,  
              resulting in a larger gap for spreading and greater leakage.      
                                                                                
       5.  Worst Case:  Assumes no contact between geomembrane and adjacent     
              soil that limits drainage rate, resulting in leakage rate         
              controlled only by the size of the hole in the geomembrane.       
                                                                                
       6.  Geotextile separating geomembrane liner and drainage limiting soil:  
              Assumes leakage spreading and rate is controlled by the in-plane  
              transmissivity of the geotextile separating the geomembrane and   
              the adjacent soil layer that would have otherwise limited the     
              drainage.  This quality would not normally be used with a         
              geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) as the controlling soil layer.      
              Upon wetting, the bentonite swells and extrudes into the          
              geotextile, filling its voids and reducing its transmissivity     
              below the point where it can contribute significantly to          
              spreading of leakage.  GCL's, when properly placed, tend to have  
              intimate contact with the geomembrane.                            
#PLACEMENT                                                                      
#TRANSMISSIVITY                                                                 
                                                                                
       Geotextile transmissivity is the product of the in-plane saturated       
  hydraulic conductivity and the thickness of the geotextile.                   
                                                                                
       The geotextile transmissivity should be specified only when a placement  
  quality of 6 is used.  The in-plane transmissivity should be given.  Typical  
  values range from 0.02 to 0.3 sq cm per sec for non-woven needle-punched      
  fabrics.  Higher values are characteristic of low overburden pressures and    
  yield greater spreading and leakage.

  4.6.4  RUNOFF CURVE NUMBER                                                    
                                                                                
       The "Runoff Curve Number Information" screen may be reached from the     
  third layer spreadsheet by pressing Page Down, or from the "Landfill General  
  Information" Screen by pressing Page Up.  A schematic of the options          
  associated with the "Runoff Curve Number Information" screen is shown in      
  Figure 16.  This screen is composed of three options that can be used to      
  specify the runoff curve number.  The first option is to use an user          
  specified curve number that the HELP model will use without modification.     
  The second option is to request the HELP model to modify a user-specified     
  curve number according to the surface slope and surface slope length.  In     
  the third option the user requests a HELP model computed runoff curve number  
  based on surface slope, slope length, soil texture of the top layer in the    
  landfill profile, and vegetation.  In order to select one of these three      
  options, the user should move the cursor to the desired option and press      
  Enter.  This will cause the program to transfer control down to the box for   
  the option selected.  For each option, the user must input all required       
  information.  Although the user can move from one box to the other (use Tab   
  and Shift/Tab keys), care should be taken to insure that the desired method   
  is the one that will be used by HELP.  The HELP model uses that option in     
  which data was last entered; this option is marked by a small arrow in front  
  of the option.                                                                
                                                                                
       The user should refer to the HELP model documentation for Version 3 for  
  the techniques used in the computation of the curve number based on slope     
  and slope length.  The value of the slope must be input in percent, and       
  slope length must be input in the units indicated.  If the top layer in the   
  landfill is obtained from the default soil/material textures, the soil        
  texture number for that layer will be displayed in the appropriate cell on    
  the screen.  The user may select another soil texture to calculate the curve  
  number.  That is, the soil texture need not agree with the soil texture of    
  the top layer, but the program will warn the user that they are different.    
  The user can solicit help on the vegetation cover by pressing the F2 key.     
#CNSELECT                                                                       
#CNAMCII                                                                        
                                                                                
       The user must also supply a value of the SCS runoff curve number for     
  Antecedent Moisture Condition II (AMC-II) or provide information so that a    
  curve number can be computed.  Unlike Version 2 of the HELP model, Version 3  
  accounts for surface slope effects on curve number and runoff.                
#CNAMCII                                                                        
#CNSLOPE                                                                        
                                                                                
       Two of the options account for surface slope.  The correlation between   
  surface slope conditions and curve number were developed for slopes ranging   
  from 1% to as high as 50% and for slope lengths ranging from 50 ft. to 2000   
  ft.                                                                           
#CNSLOPE                                                                        
#CNTEXTURE                                                                      
                                                                                
       If the user selects the option that requires the HELP model to compute   
  the curve number, the program calculates the SCS runoff curve number based    
  on the vegetation type and the selected soil texture if one of the            
  default soil/material textures is selected (soil texture types 1 through 18,  
  20 and 22 through 33).  If the top layer in the landfill is described by one  
  of the default soil/material textures, the soil texture number for that       
  layer will be displayed in the appropriate cell on the screen.  The user may  
  select another soil texture to calculate the curve number.  That is, the      
  soil texture need not agree with the soil texture of the top layer, but the   
  program will warn the user that they are different.  The equation used to     
  calculate the SCS runoff curve number was developed for landfills with mild   
  surface slopes (2 to 5 percent).  HELP Version 3 adjusts the SCS runoff       
  curve number based on the surface slope and the length of the slope.          
                                                                                
#CNTEXTURE

  1.  An AMC-II curve number is defined by the user and the program uses it     
  with modifications only for soil moisture content.  Some general guidance     
  for selection of runoff curve numbers is provided in Figure 2 (USDA,          
  Soil Conservation Service, National Engineering Handbook, Section 4,          
  Hydrology, 1985).

#CNMODIFY                                                                       
                                                                                
  2.  An AMC-II curve number is defined by the user and modified according to   
  the landfill's surface slope and slope length.  The modified AMC-II curve     
  number is later modified during the simulation as a function of soil          
  moisture content.  Some general guidance for selection of runoff curve        
  number is provided in Figure 2 (USDA, Soil Conservation Service, National     
  Engineering Handbook, Section 4, Hydrology, 1985).                            
                                                                                
#CNMODIFY                                                                       
#CNHELP                                                                         
                                                                                
  3.  A curve number is computed by the HELP model based on landfill surface    
  slope, slope length, soil texture of the top layer, and the vegetative        
  cover.  Some general guidance for selection of runoff curve numbers is        
  provided in Figure 2 (USDA, Soil Conservation Service, National Engineering   
  Handbook, Section 4, Hydrology, 1985).                                        
#CNHELP                                                                         
#D10VERIFY                                                                      
                                                                                
  4.6.5  VERIFY AND SAVE SOIL AND DESIGN DATA                                   
                                                                                
       Pressing F10 anywhere in the soil and design option transfers control    
  to the "Verification and Saving" screen.  This screen provides the user with  
  several options:  verify landfill general design data, verify soil            
  layer/geomembrane properties, verify layer arrangement, review/save user-     
  defined soil textures, and save soil and design data.  The user can select    
  any of these options by moving the cursor to the option and pressing Enter.   
  Figure 17 shows the verify and save soil and design data options.             
                                                                                
       If the user selects the "Save Soil and Design Data" option, the program  
  automatically checks for possible violation of rules or errors in the soil    
  and design data.  This checking encompasses verification of presence,         
  arrangement and values entered for the general landfill information, the      
  landfill profile and layer data, and the runoff curve number information.     
  The program scans through the three landfill profile spreadsheets of layer    
  data one layer at a time and reports the errors as they are encountered.  If  
  any violations or inconsistencies are found, the displays them on multiple    
  screens.  The user should press Enter or Page Down to proceed through the     
  screens and reach the "File Saving" screen where the data can be saved in a   
  file.  If the user wishes to return to "Verification and Saving" screen,      
  press Esc.                                                                    
                                                                                
#D10VERIFY                                                                      
#VLANDFILL                                                                      
                                                                                
       The user can verify the data before attempting to save the data by       
  exercising the first three options on the "Verification and Saving" screen.   
  These options are available mainly for the convenience of the new user since  
  experienced users will generally have no violations and the data will be      
  verified before saving anyway.  To check the data entered on the general      
  landfill and runoff information screens, the user should select the first     
  option, "Verify Landfill General Information Design Data."  If there are no   
  violations or warnings, the program will write "OK" to the right of the       
  option; otherwise the program will list the problems and then write "BAD" to  
  the right of the option.                                                      
#VLANDFILL                                                                      
#VSOILDATA                                                                      
                                                                                
       The user can check the layer descriptions (the values on a row of the    
  third screens of layer data) by selecting the "Verify Soil Layer/Geomembrane  
  Properties" option.  The program will examine each row for completeness for   
  the type of layer described; for example, it will insure that a placement     
  quality was entered for all geomembrane liners  (layer type 4).  It will      
  also check for the appropriateness of the values; for example, it will        
  insure that the porosity is greater than the field capacity.  If there are    
  no violations or warnings, the program will write "OK" to the right of the    
  option; otherwise the program will list the problems and then write "BAD" to  
  the right of the option.                                                      
#VSOILDATA                                                                      
#VLAYERS                                                                        
                                                                                
       Similarly, the user can check for violations in the ordering of the      
  layers from top to bottom based on the layer types specified by selecting     
  the "Verify Layer Arrangement" option.  This option will check the nine       
  rules for ordering of layers; for example, the program will insure that the   
  top layer is not a liner.  This option operates in the same manner as the     
  verification options.                                                         
#VLAYERS                                                                        
#USERSOIL                                                                       
                                                                                
       Another available option on this screen is to review the user defined    
  soil textures that were used in the landfill profile for inclusion in or      
  deletion from the library of user defined soil textures.  Upon selecting      
  this option, the program lists all of the non-zero user-defined soil          
  textures used in the profile and allows the user to enter or edit a name to   
  describe the material in the user soil library.  Then after entering the      
  names or labels, the user should tag all of the soil textures to be included  
  in the library with a "Y" in the column of cells under the "SAVE" heading.    
  Similarly, the user should tag all of the soil textures to be deleted from    
  or not included in the library with a "N" in the column of cells under the    
  "SAVE" heading.  To complete the additions and deletions to the library, the  
  user should press F10; to cancel the additions and deletions and return to    
  the "Verification and Saving" screen, press Esc or F9.                        
                                                                                
#USERSOIL                                                                       
#D10SAVE                                                                        
                                                                                
       Upon reaching the "File Saving" screen, the user can return to the       
  verification and input screens to correct violations by editing the data.     
  To return, press Page Up successively until the desired screen is reached.    
  On the other hand, the user can still save the data now and make corrections  
  at a later time if there were violations.  However, it should not be          
  expected that the HELP model will provide meaningful answers for such data.   
                                                                                
       Soil and design data are saved in a file specified on the "Soil and      
  Design Data - File Saving" screen.  The program displays the default file     
  name, DATA10, for saving in the default directory.  DATA10 is the same name   
  for the soil and design data as used in Version 2 except that Version 3 adds  
  an extension of .D10 to the specified soil and design data file name.  To     
  save the data, the user should enter "Y" in the "Save" column.  Then, the     
  user should specify the directory in which to save the file.  If the          
  directory cannot be found, the program respond "Invalid Directory." and       
  replaces it with the default directory.  After the directory, the user        
  should enter the file name (no extension or period).  If the file already     
  exists, the program will display "File Already Exists."  After entering the   
  file name, the user should press F10 or Pg Dn to complete the saving to the   
  requested file name.  If file already exists as the default file would, the   
  program will ask whether the user wishes to have the existing file            
  overwritten.  If the user answers "Yes," the program will overwrite the       
  file, complete the saving process and return to the main menu.  If the user   
  answers "No," the program will interrupt the saving, return to the "SAVE"     
  column and change the tag to "N."  The user can then change the tag back to   
  "Y", rename the file, and restart the saving by pressing F10 or Pg Dn.  The   
  program provides other options listed on the "File Saving" screen to provide  
  the means for the user to display of a directory of existing soil and design  
  data files (F4), to return to the data entry screens (Pg Up) or to return to  
  the main menu without saving the data (F9).  The user must be cautioned that  
  the F9 option will cause all the data created (if any) to be lost.  Figure    
  17 shows the available options.                                               
                                                                                
#D10SAVE                                                                        
#SAVETAG                                                                        
                                                                                
       From the "File Saving" screen the user may save the soil and design      
  data, or completely abandon the save option.  The user should enter a "Y"     
  in the "SAVE" column to save the data or enter a "N" in the "SAVE" column     
  to exit without saving or changing the data file.                             
#SAVETAG                                                                        
#PATHS                                                                          
                                                                                
       When naming a file to be saved, the DOS path may be specified if         
  different from the active or default drive and subdirectory, such as          
  C:\HELP3\DATA.  The default directory is initially displayed in the           
  directory cell on the screen.  If the user specifies a drive or a directory   
  that does not exist, the program will display respectively "INVALID DRIVE"    
  or "INVALID DIRECTORY" and replaces the content with the default directory.   
                                                                                
#FILES                                                                          
       The current directory is displayed on the screen.  The user may obtain   
  a listing of all soil and design data files that reside on the current        
  directory by pressing F4.  Up to 120 data file names can be displayed on the  
  screen.  The name of the current directory where these files are located is   
  also displayed.  To obtain the data files that reside in another directory,   
  the user should type in the name of a valid drive and subdirectory in the     
  Directory column and then press F4 for the list of files.                     
                                                                                
#PATHS                                                                          
       To select a file from the list of displayed files, move the cursor to    
  the desired file name and press Enter.  This action transfers control back    
  to the previous screen, and the name of the file just selected will be        
  displayed in the proper cell.  The user can exit the "Data Files" screen      
  without selecting a file by pressing the Esc key.                             
                                                                                
       File names may also be typed in the proper cells.  The data file may     
  have any valid DOS name of up to 8 characters.  If the user enters an         
  illegal file name, the program displays "BAD FILE NAME" and clears the file   
  name.  The previously entered file name is erased and the user has another    
  opportunity to enter a correct file name.
