       This user's guide is an extract of the published user'S guide cited at   
  the end of this abstract and presents guidance on the use of the Hydrologic   
  Evaluation of Landfill Performance (HELP) computer program.                   
                                                                                
       This report explains how to use Version 3 of the Hydrologic Evaluation   
  of Landfill Performance (HELP) model.  Section 1 provides an overview of the  
  model and software and hardware requirements.  Section 2 describes basic      
  landfill design and liquids management concepts.  Section 3 presents          
  definitions, options and limitations for input parameters as well as          
  detailed guidance for selecting their input values.  Section 4 provides       
  detailed instructions on how to enter input, run the simulation and view or   
  print output.  Appendix A provides assistance for estimating material         
  properties for moisture retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity.       
                                                                                
       The user interface or input facility is written in the Quick Basic       
  environment of Microsoft Basic Professional Development System Version 7.1    
  and runs under DOS on IBM-PC and compatible computers.  The HELP program      
  uses an interactive and a user-friendly input facility designed to provide    
  the user with as much assistance as possible in preparing data to run the     
  model.  The program provides weather and soil data file management, default   
  data sources, interactive layer editing, on-line help, and data verification  
  and accepts weather data from the most commonly used sources with several     
  different formats.                                                            
                                                                                
       HELP Version 3 represents a significant advancement over the input       
  techniques of Version 2.  Users of the HELP model should find HELP Version 3  
  easy to use and should be able to use it for many purposes such as preparing  
  and editing landfill profiles and weather data.  Version 3 facilitates use    
  of metric units, international applications and designs with geosynthetic     
  materials.

       The Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance (HELP) computer        
  program is a quasi-two-dimensional hydrologic model of water movement         
  across, into, through and out of landfills.  The model accepts weather, soil  
  and design data and uses solution techniques that account for the effects of  
  surface storage, snowmelt, runoff, infiltration, evapotranspiration,          
  vegetative growth, soil moisture storage, lateral subsurface drainage,        
  leachate recirculation, unsaturated vertical drainage and leakage through     
  soil, geomembrane or composite liners.  Landfill systems including various    
  combinations of vegetation, cover soils, waste cells, lateral drain layers,   
  low permeability barrier soils, and synthetic geomembrane liners may be       
  modeled.  The program was developed to conduct water balance analysis of      
  landfills, cover systems and solid waste disposal and containment             
  facilities.  As such, the model facilitates rapid estimation of the amounts   
  of runoff, evapotranspiration, drainage, leachate collection and liner        
  leakage that may be expected to result from the operation of a wide variety   
  of landfill designs.  The primary purpose of the model is to assist in the    
  comparison of design alternatives as judged by their water balances.  The     
  model, applicable to open, partially closed and fully closed sites, is a      
  tool for both designers and permit writers.                                   
                                                                                
1.1  BACKGROUND                                                                 
                                                                                
       The HELP program, Versions 1, 2 and 3, was developed by the U.S. Army    
  Engineer Waterways Experiment Station (WES), Vicksburg, MS, for the U.S.      
  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Risk Reduction Engineering             
  Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH.  The program was developed in response to needs   
  in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and Comprehensive        
  Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, better known  
  as Superfund) as identified by the EPA Office of Solid Waste, Washington,     
  DC.                                                                           
                                                                                
       HELP Version 1 (Schroeder et al., 1984) represented a major advance      
  beyond the Hydrologic Simulation on Solid Waste Disposal Sites (HSSWDS)       
  program (Perrier and Gibson, 1980; Schroeder and Gibson, 1982) which was      
  also developed at WES.  The HSSWDS model simulated only the cover system,     
  did not model lateral flow through drainage layers, and handled vertical      
  drainage only in a rudimentary manner.  The infiltration, percolation and     
  evapotranspiration routines were almost identical to those used in the        
  Chemicals, Runoff, and Erosion from Agricultural Management Systems (CREAMS)  
  model, which was developed by Knisel (1980) for the U.S. Department of        
  Agriculture (USDA).  The runoff and infiltration routines relied heavily      
  on the Hydrology Section of the National Engineering Handbook (USDA, Soil     
  Conservation Service, 1972).  Version 1 of the HELP model incorporated a      
  lateral subsurface drainage model and improved unsaturated drainage and       
  liner leakage models into the HSSWDS model.  In addition, the HELP model      
  provided simulation of the entire landfill including leachate collection and  
  liner systems.                                                                
                                                                                
       In Version 2 (Schroeder et al., 1988), the capabilities of the HELP      
  model were greatly enhanced.  The WGEN synthetic weather generator developed  
  by the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) (Richardson and Wright,       
  1984) was added to the model to yield daily values of precipitation,          
  temperature and solar radiation, replacing the use of normal mean monthly     
  temperature and solar radiation values and improving the modeling of snow     
  and evapotranspiration.  Also, a vegetative growth model from the Simulator   
  for Water Resources in Rural Basins (SWRRB) model developed by the ARS        
  (Arnold et al., 1986) was merged into the HELP model to calculate daily leaf  
  area indices.  Modeling of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and flow and    
  lateral drainage computations were improved.  Accuracy was increased with     
  the use of double precision.  Default soil data were improved, and the model  
  permitted use of more layers and initialization of soil moisture content.     
  Input and editing were simplified.  Output was clarified, and standard        
  deviations were reported.                                                     
                                                                                
       In Version 3 the HELP model has been greatly enhanced beyond Version 2.  
  The number of layers that can be modeled has been increased.  The default     
  soil/material texture list has been expanded to contain additional waste      
  materials, geomembranes, geosynthetic drainage nets and compacted soils.      
  The model also permits the use of an user-built library of soil textures.     
  Computation of leachate recirculation between soil layers and groundwater     
  drainage into the landfill have been added.  Moreover, HELP Version 3         
  accounts for leakage through geomembranes due to manufacturing defects        
  (pinholes) and installation defects (punctures, tears and seaming flaws) and  
  by vapor diffusion through the liner.  The estimation of runoff from the      
  surface of the landfill has been improved to account for large landfill       
  surface slopes and slope lengths.  The snowmelt model has been replaced with  
  an energy-based model and the potential evaporation model has been replaced   
  with a Penman method incorporating wind and humidity effects as well as long  
  wave radiation losses (heat loss at night).  A frozen soil model has been     
  added to improve infiltration and runoff predictions in cold regions.  The    
  unsaturated vertical drainage model has also been improved to aid in storage  
  computations.  Input and editing have been simplified further by using        
  interactive input techniques.                                                 
                                                                                
       In addition, the HELP model Version 3 provides a variety of methods for  
  specifying precipitation, temperature and solar radiation data.  Now, data    
  from the most commonly available (government and commercial) sources may be   
  easier to enter.  Moreover, data used in HELP Version 2 can still be used     
  with minimum user effort.  Facilities for creating weather data manually and  
  editing weather data can be easily done by using built-in spreadsheet         
  facilities.                                                                   
                                                                                
       The use of data files has been made much simpler and more convenient     
  than HELP Version 2 by using user defined file names, permitting permanent    
  storage in a user-specified location.  Similarly, the user has more           
  flexibility in defining units for every type of data needed to run HELP.      
  Finally, Version 3 of the HELP model provides on-line help on every step of   
  data preparation process.                                                     
                                                                                
       The HELP model is applicable to most landfill applications but was       
  developed specifically to perform hazardous and municipal waste disposal      
  landfill evaluations as required by the Resource Conservation and Recovery    
  Act.  Hazardous waste disposal landfills generally should have a liner to     
  prevent migration of waste out of the landfill, a final cover to minimize     
  the production of leachate following closure, careful controls of runon and   
  runoff, and limits on the build-up of leachate head over the liner to no      
  more than 1 ft.  The HELP model is useful for predicting the amounts of       
  runoff, drainage, and leachate expected for reasonable designs as well as     
  the build-up of leachate above the liner.  However, the model should not be   
  expected to produce credible results from input nonrepresentative of          
  landfills.                                                                    
                                                                                
1.2  OVERVIEW                                                                   
                                                                                
       The principal purpose of this user's guide is to provide the basic       
  information needed to use the computer program.  Thus, while some attention   
  must be given to definitions, descriptions of variables and interpretation    
  of results, only a minimal amount of such information is provided.  Detailed  
  documentation providing in-depth coverage of the theory and assumptions       
  is available (Schroeder et al., 1994).  Potential HELP users are strongly     
  encouraged to study the documentation and this user's guide before            
  attempting to use the program to evaluate a landfill design.  Additional      
  documentation concerning the sensitivity of program inputs, application of    
  the model and verification of model predictions are under development.

                    BASIC LANDFILL DESIGN CONCEPTS                              
                                                                                
2.1  BACKGROUND                                                                 
                                                                                
       Over the past 20 to 30 years, the sanitary landfill has come to be       
  widely recognized as an economical and effective means for disposal of        
  municipal and industrial solid wastes.  Today, modern methods of landfill     
  construction and management are sufficiently developed to ensure that even    
  large volumes of such materials can be handled and disposed of in such a way  
  as to protect public health and minimize adverse effects on the environment.  
                                                                                
       Recently, public attention has been focused on a special class of        
  materials commonly referred to as hazardous wastes.  The chemical and         
  physical diversity, environmental persistence, and acute and chronic          
  detrimental effects on human, plant and animal health of many of these        
  substances are such that great care must be exercised in their disposal.      
  Hazardous wastes are produced in such large quantities and are so diverse     
  that universally acceptable disposal methods have yet to be devised.          
  However, for the present, disposal or storage in secure landfills is usually  
  a prudent approach.  The current state of the art is an extension of          
  sanitary landfill technology using very conservative design criteria.  Some   
  important basic principles and concepts of landfill design are summarized     
  below.  Specific emphasis is given to disposal of hazardous materials, but    
  the discussion is applicable to ordinary sanitary landfills as well.          
                                                                                
2.2  LEACHATE PRODUCTION                                                        
                                                                                
       Storage of any waste material in a landfill poses several potential      
  problems.  One is the possible contamination of soil, groundwater and         
  surface water that may occur as leachate produced by water or liquid wastes   
  moving into, through and out of the landfill migrates into adjacent areas.    
  This problem is especially important when hazardous wastes are involved       
  because many of these substances are quite resistant to biological or         
  chemical degradation and, thus, are expected to persist in their original     
  form for many years, perhaps even for centuries.  Given this possibility it   
  is desirable for hazardous waste landfills to be designed to prevent any      
  waste or leachate from ever moving into adjacent areas.  This objective is    
  beyond the capability of current technology but does represent a goal in the  
  design and operation of today's landfills.  The HELP model has been           
  developed specifically as a tool to be used by designers and regulatory       
  reviewers for selecting practical designs that minimize potential             
  contamination problems.                                                       
                                                                                
       In the context of a landfill, leachate is described as liquid that has   
  percolated through the layers of waste material.  Thus, leachate may be       
  composed of liquids that originate from a number of sources including         
  precipitation, groundwater, consolidation, initial moisture storage and       
  reactions associated with decomposition of waste materials.  The chemical     
  quality of leachate varies as a function of a number of factors including     
  the quantity produced, the original nature of the buried waste materials and  
  the various chemical and biochemical reactions that may occur as the waste    
  materials decompose. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, most         
  regulatory agencies prefer to assume that any leachate produced will          
  contaminate either ground or surface waters; in the light of the potential    
  water quality impact of leachate contamination, this approach appears         
  reasonable.                                                                   
                                                                                
       The quantity of leachate produced is affected to some extent by          
  decomposition reactions but is largely governed by the amount of external     
  water entering the landfill.  Thus, a key first step in controlling leachate  
  contamination is to limit production by preventing, to the extent feasible,   
  the entry of external water into the waste layers.  A second step is to       
  collect any leachate that is produced for subsequent treatment and disposal.  
  Techniques are currently available to limit the amount of leachate that       
  migrates into adjoining areas to a virtually immeasurable volume, as long as  
  the integrity of the landfill structure and leachate control system is        
  maintained.                                                                   
                                                                                
2.3  DESIGN FOR LEACHATE CONTROL                                                
                                                                                
       A schematic profile view of a somewhat typical hazardous waste landfill  
  is shown in Figure 1 of the published User's Guide.  The bottom layer of      
  soil may be hauled in, placed and compacted to specifications following       
  excavation to a suitable subgrade or may be naturally existing material.  In  
  either case, the base of the landfill should act as a liner having some       
  minimum thickness and a very low hydraulic conductivity (or permeability).    
  Treatments may be used on the barrier soil to reduce its permeability to an   
  acceptable level.  As an added factor of safety, an impermeable synthetic     
  membrane may be placed on the top of the barrier soil layer to form a         
  composite liner.                                                              
                                                                                
       Immediately above the bottom composite liner is a leakage detection      
  drainage layer to collect leakage from the primary liner, in this case, a     
  geomembrane.  Above the primary liner are a geosynthetic drainage net and a   
  sand layer that serve as drainage layers for leachate collection.  The drain  
  layers composed of sand are typically at least 1-ft thick and have suitably   
  spaced perforated or open joint drain pipe embedded below the surface of the  
  liner.  The leachate collection drainage layer serves to collect any          
  leachate that may percolate through the waste layers.  In this case where     
  the liner is solely a geomembrane, a drainage net is used to drain leachate   
  from the liner before significant head is built up on the liner so as not to  
  promote leakage.  The drainage layers are sloped to prevent ponding by        
  encouraging leachate to flow toward the drains.  The net effect is that very  
  little leachate should percolate through the primary liner and virtually no   
  migration of leachate through the bottom composite liner to the natural       
  formations below.  Taken as a whole, the drainage layers, geomembrane         
  liners, and barrier soil liners may be referred to as the leachate            
  collection and removal system (drainage/liner system) and more specifically   
  a double liner system.                                                        
                                                                                
       After the landfill is closed, the leachate collection and removal        
  system serves basically in a back-up capacity.  However, while the landfill   
  is open and waste is being added, these components constitute the principal   
  defense against contamination of adjacent areas.  Thus, care must be given    
  to their design and construction.                                             
                                                                                
       Day-to-day operation of a modern sanitary landfill calls for wastes to   
  be placed in relatively thin lifts, compacted, and covered with soil each     
  day.  Thus, wastes should not be left exposed more than a few hours.          
  Although the daily soil cover serves effectively to hide the wastes and       
  limit the access of nuisance insects and potential disease vectors, it is of  
  limited value for preventing the formation of leachate.  Thus, even though a  
  similar procedure can be used for hazardous wastes, it is imperative that     
  the drainage/liner system function well throughout and after the active life  
  of the landfill.                                                              
                                                                                
       When the capacity of the landfill is reached, the waste cells may be     
  covered with a cap or final cover, typically composed of three distinct       
  layers as shown in Figure 1.  At the base of the cap is a drainage layer and  
  a liner system layer similar to that used at the base of the landfill.        
  Again, a geomembrane liner would normally be used in conjunction with the     
  barrier soil liner for hazardous waste landfill but has been used less        
  frequently in municipal waste landfills.  The top of the barrier soil layer   
  is graded so that water percolating into the drainage layer will tend to      
  move horizontally toward some removal system (drain) located at the edge of   
  the landfill or subunit thereof.                                              
                                                                                
       A layer of soil suitable for vegetative growth is placed at the top of   
  final cover system to complete the landfill.  A 2-ft-thick layer of soil      
  having a loamy, silty nature serves this purpose well.  The upper surface is  
  graded so that runon is restricted and infiltration is controlled to provide  
  moisture for vegetation while limiting percolation through the topsoil.       
  Runoff is promoted but controlled to prevent excessive erosion of the cap.    
  The vegetation used should be selected for ease of establishment in a given   
  area, promotion of evapotranspiration and year-round protection from          
  erosion.  The root system should not penetrate and disrupt the upper barrier  
  liner or desiccate the liner system.  Grasses are usually best for this       
  purpose; however, local experts should be consulted to aid in selection of    
  appropriate species.                                                          
                                                                                
       The combination of site selection, surface grading, transpiration from   
  vegetation, soil evaporation, drainage through the sand and the low           
  hydraulic conductivity of the barrier soil liner serves effectively to        
  minimize leachate production from external water.  Added effectiveness is     
  gained by the use of geomembrane liners in the cap in conjunction with the    
  barrier soil liner.  It is important that the cap should be no more           
  permeable than the leachate collection and removal system so that the         
  landfill will not gradually fill and overflow into adjacent areas following   
  abandonment of the landfill.  This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as     
  the ~bathtub~ effect.                                                         
                                                                                
       The HELP model is designed to perform water balance calculations for     
  landfills having as many as 20 layers by modeling each of the hydrologic      
  processes that occur.  Thus, the model can be used to design a landfill to    
  achieve specific goals.

                  PROGRAM DEFINITIONS, OPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS                  
                                                                                
3.1  INTRODUCTION                                                               
                                                                                
       The HELP program was developed to provide landfill designers and         
  regulators with a tool for rapid, economical screening of alternative         
  designs.  The program may be used to estimate the magnitudes of various       
  components of the water budget, including the volume of leachate produced     
  and the thickness of water-saturated soil (head) above liners.  The results   
  may be used to compare the leachate production potential of alternative       
  designs, to select and size appropriate drainage and collection systems, and  
  to size leachate treatment facilities.                                        
                                                                                
       The program uses weather (climatological), soil and design data to       
  generate daily estimates of water movement across, into, through and out of   
  landfills.  To accomplish this and compute a water balance, daily             
  precipitation is partitioned into surface storage (snow), snowmelt,           
  interception, runoff, infiltration, surface evaporation, subsurface           
  evapotranspiration, subsurface moisture storage, liner leakage                
  (percolation), and subsurface lateral drainage to collection, removal and     
  recirculation systems.                                                        
                                                                                
       This section discusses nomenclature, important assumptions and           
  limitations, and other fundamental information needed to run the program.     
  The documentation manual (Schroeder et al., 1994) contains detailed           
  explanations of the solution techniques employed.                             
                                                                                
3.8  OVERVIEW OF MODELING PROCEDURE                                             
                                                                                
       The hydrologic processes modeled by the program can be divided into two  
  categories:  surface processes and subsurface processes.  The surface         
  processes modeled are snowmelt, interception of rainfall by vegetation,       
  surface runoff, and surface evaporation.  The subsurface processes modeled    
  are evaporation from soil profile, plant transpiration, unsaturated vertical  
  drainage, barrier soil liner percolation, geomembrane leakage and saturated   
  lateral drainage.                                                             
                                                                                
       Daily infiltration into the landfill is determined indirectly from a     
  surface water balance.  Infiltration is assumed to equal the sum of           
  rainfall, surface storage and snowmelt minus the sum of runoff, additional    
  storage in snowpack and evaporation of surface water.  No liquid water is     
  assumed to be held in surface storage from one day to the next except in the  
  snowpack or when the top soil is saturated and runoff is not permitted.       
  Each day, the available water for infiltration, runoff or evaporation from    
  water on the surface is determined from the surface storage, discharge from   
  the snowpack and/or rainfall.  Snowfall is added to the surface snow storage  
  which is depleted by either evaporation or melting.  Snowmelt is added to     
  the available water and is treated as rainfall except that it is not          
  intercepted by vegetation.  This available water is used to compute the       
  runoff by the SCS rainfall-runoff relationship.  The interception is the      
  measure of water available to evaporate from the surface.  Interception in    
  excess of the potential evaporation is added to infiltration.  Surface        
  evaporation is then computed.  Potential evaporation from the surface is      
  first applied to the interception; any excess is applied to the snowmelt,     
  then to the snowpack and finally to the groundmelt.  Potential evaporation    
  in excess of the evaporation from the surface is applied to the soil column   
  and plant transpiration.  The snowmelt and rainfall that does not run off or  
  evaporate is assumed to infiltrate into the landfill along with any           
  groundmelt that does not evaporate.                                           
                                                                                
       The first subsurface processes considered are soil evaporation and       
  plant transpiration from the evaporative zone of the upper subprofile.  A     
  vegetative growth model accounts for the daily growth and decay of the        
  surface vegetation. The other subsurface processes are modeled one            
  subprofile at a time, from top to bottom, using a design dependent time step  
  ranging from 30 minutes to 6 hours.  A storage-routing procedure is used to   
  redistribute the soil water among the modeling segments that comprise the     
  subprofile.  This procedure accounts for infiltration or percolation into     
  the subprofile and evapotranspiration from the evaporative zone.  Then, if    
  the subprofile contains a liner, the program computes the head on the liner.  
  The head on the liner is then used to compute the leakage/percolation         
  through the liner and, if lateral drainage is permitted above the top of the  
  liner, the lateral drainage to the collection and removal system.             
                                                                                
3.9  ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS                                                
                                                                                
3.9.1  Solution Methods                                                         
                                                                                
       The modeling procedures documented in the previous section are           
  necessarily based on many simplifying assumptions.  Generally, these          
  assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objectives of the program  
  when applied to standard landfill designs.  However, some of these            
  assumptions may not be reasonable for unusual designs.  The major             
  assumptions and limitations of the program are summarized below.              
                                                                                
       Runoff is computed using the SCS method based on daily amounts of        
  rainfall and snowmelt.  The program assumes that areas adjacent to the        
  landfill do not drain onto the landfill.  The time distribution of rainfall   
  intensity is not considered.  The program cannot be expected to give          
  accurate estimates of runoff volumes for individual storm events on the       
  basis of daily rainfall data. However, because the SCS rainfall-runoff        
  relationship is based on considerable daily field data, long-term estimates   
  of runoff should be reasonable.  The SCS method does not explicitly consider  
  the length and slope of the surface over which overland flow occurs.  This    
  limitation has been removed by developing and implementing into the HELP      
  input routine a procedure for computing curve numbers that take into          
  consideration the effect of slope and slope length.  The limitation,          
  however,  remains on the user specified curve number (the first method).      
  This limitation is not a concern provided that the slope and slope length of  
  the landfill do not differ dramatically from those of the test plots upon     
  which the SCS method is based.  The SCS method would probably underestimate   
  runoff somewhat where the overland-flow distance is very short or the slope   
  is very steep or when the rainfall duration is very short and the intensity   
  is very high.                                                                 
                                                                                
       The HELP model assumes Darcian flow by gravity influences through        
  homogeneous soil and waste layers.  It does not consider explicitly           
  preferential flow through channels such as cracks, root holes, or animal      
  burrows but allows for vertical drainage through the evaporative zone at      
  moisture contents below field capacity.  Similarly, the program allows        
  vertical drainage from a layer at moisture contents below field capacity      
  when the inflow would occupy a significant fraction of the available storage  
  capacity below capacity.  The drainage rate out of a segment is assumed to    
  equal the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the segment corresponding to  
  its moisture content, provided that the underlying segment is not a liner     
  and is not saturated.  In addition to these special cases, the drainage rate  
  out of a segment can be limited by the saturated hydraulic conductivity of    
  the segment below it.  When limited, the program computes an effective        
  gradient for saturated flow through the lower segment.  This permits          
  vertical percolation or lateral drainage layers to be arranged without        
  restrictions on their properties so long as they perform as their layer       
  description implies and not as liners.                                        
                                                                                
       The model assumes that  a) the soil moisture retention properties and    
  unsaturated hydraulic conductivity can be calculated from the saturated       
  hydraulic conductivity and limited soil moisture retention parameters         
  (porosity, field capacity and wilting point) and  b) that the soil moisture   
  retention properties fit a Brooks-Corey relation (Brooks et al., 1964)        
  defined by the three soil moisture retention parameters.  Upon obtaining the  
  Brooks-Corey parameters, the model assumes that the unsaturated hydraulic     
  conductivity relationship with soil moisture is well described by the         
  Campbell equation.                                                            
                                                                                
       The model does not explicitly compute flow by differences in soil        
  suction (soil suction gradient) and as such does not model the draw of water  
  upward by capillary drying.  This draw of water upward is modeled as an       
  extraction rather than transport of water upward.  Therefore, it is           
  important that the evaporative zone depth be specified as the depth of        
  capillary drying.  Drainage downward by soil suction exerted by dry soils     
  lower in the landfill profile is modeled as Darcian flow for any soil having  
  a relative moisture content greater than the lower soils.  The drainage rate  
  is equal to the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity computed as a function of  
  the soil moisture content.  As such, the rate is assumed to be independent    
  of the pressure gradient.                                                     
                                                                                
       Leakage through barrier soil liners is modeled as saturated Darcian      
  flow.  Leakage is assumed to occur only as long as there is head on the       
  surface of the liner.  It is assumed that the head driving the percolation    
  can be represented by the average head across the entire liner and can be     
  estimated from the soil moisture storage.  It is also assumed that the liner  
  underlies the entire area of the landfill and, conservatively, that when      
  leakage occurs, the entire area of the landfill leaks.  The model does not    
  consider aging or drying of the liner and therefore the saturated hydraulic   
  conductivity of the liner does not vary as a function of time.                
                                                                                
       Geomembranes are assumed to leak primarily through holes.  The leakage   
  passes through the holes and spreads between the geomembrane and soil until   
  the head is dissipated.  The leakage then percolates through the soil at the  
  rate dependent on the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the pressure       
  gradient.  Therefore, the net effect of a geomembrane is to reduce the area   
  of percolation through the liner system.  The program assumes the holes to    
  be uniformly distributed and the head is distributed across the entire liner. 
  The model does not consider aging of the liner and therefore the number and   
  size of the holes do not vary as a function of time.  In addition, it is      
  conservatively assumed that the head on the holes can be represented by the   
  average head across the entire liner and can be estimated from the soil       
  moisture storage.  It is also assumed that the liner underlies the entire     
  area of the landfill.                                                         
                                                                                
       The lateral drainage model is based on the assumption that the           
  saturated depth profile is characteristic of the steady-state profile for     
  the given average depth of saturation.  As such, it is assumed that the       
  lateral drainage rate for steady-state drainage at a given average depth of   
  saturation is representative of unsteady lateral drainage rate for the same   
  average saturated depth.  In actuality the rate would be somewhat larger for  
  periods when the depth is building and somewhat smaller for periods when the  
  depth is falling.  Steady drainage implies that saturated conditions exist    
  above the entire surface of the liner, agreeing with the assumptions for      
  leakage through liner systems.                                                
                                                                                
       The model assumes the vegetative growth and decay can be characterized   
  by a vegetative growth model developed for crops and perennial grasses.  In   
  addition, it is assumed that the vegetation transpires water, shades the      
  surface, intercepts rainfall and reduces runoff in similar quantities as      
  grasses or as an adjusted equivalence of LAI.

4.1  INTRODUCTION                                                               
                                                                                
       The procedures and options available to input data, execute the model,   
  and obtain results are described in detail in the F1 help messages            
  throughout the program and in Section 4 of the published User's Guide.  The   
  discussion includes general input information, some definitions and rules,    
  the program structure and detailed explanations of the options reached from   
  the Main Menu.  Guidance is given throughout the section for selecting the    
  most appropriate values in certain situations, but the main purpose of this   
  section is to describe the mechanics of using the user interface.  Detailed   
  guidance on the definitions of input parameters and selection of their        
  values are presented in Section 3 and in the F2 help messages throughout the  
  program.  Guidance on use of the keys for selecting options, proceeding       
  through the program and entering data are provided in the F3 help message.    
                                                                                
       Version 3 of the HELP program is started by typing "HELP3" from the DOS  
  prompt in the directory where the program resides.  The program starts by     
  displaying a title screen, a preface, a disclaimer and then the main menu.    
  The user moves from the title screen to the main menu by striking any key     
  such as the space bar.  Upon reaching the main menu, the user can select any  
  of seven options.  The program automatically solicits input from the user     
  based on the option selected.  In general the HELP model requires the         
  following data, some of which may be selected from the default values.

4.2  DEFINITIONS AND RULES                                                      
                                                                                
       There are a few fundamental rules regarding the input facility that a    
  user must keep in mind when using the model.  These rules should be followed  
  to move around the screens and to move within the same screen.  Below are     
  some definitions and rules.                                                   
                                                                                
  1.  Screens.  A screen in the HELP user interface as used in this report is   
      a single screen of information.  These screens are divided into three     
      categories:                                                               
                                                                                
      *  Input Screen:  a screen on which the user can input data               
                                                                                
      *  Selection Screen:  a screen from which the user selects an entry from  
         a list                                                                 
                                                                                
      *  On-line Help Screen:  a screen where assistance is provided.  General  
         assistance on the interface is displayed by pressing the F1 key,       
         technical assistance by pressing the F2 key, and key operations by     
         pressing the F3 key.                                                   
                                                                                
         This terminology is used throughout this section.  Each module         
      consists of two types of screens:  "primary" and "secondary" screens.     
      Primary screens are main screens that form a loop for each option of      
      HELP.  Secondary screens are displayed from the primary screens as part   
      of the input process.  These screens can be input screens or selection    
      screens.                                                                  
                                                                                
  2.  Input Cells.  When the program highlights a number of spaces (called an   
      ~input cell~ throughout this section), an input from the user is          
      expected.  At any input cell, the user has one of several options:        
      enter the data requested, accept existing value, seek on-line help, or    
      select one of the menu items listed at the bottom of the screen.  Each    
      cell is associated with a variable that is used directly or indirectly    
      in the HELP model.  Therefore, every effort must be made to assign a      
      value to each cell when applicable.  The user may input the value the     
      first time around, or return to the cell at a later time during the       
      program session.  If an input cell is left blank, a value of 0 will be    
      assigned to the corresponding variable.  If 0 is not an appropriate       
      answer to the question, it will produce erroneous results.  The program   
      will warn the user when a blank or zero is an inappropriate value.        
                                                                                
         Trailing decimal points are not required on input since the program    
      automatically knows whether to treat a value as an integer or a floating  
      point variable.  For example, if a user wishes to enter the number nine,  
      either 9, 9. or 9.00 is acceptable, provided the input cell is wide       
      enough.                                                                   
                                                                                
  3.  Selection Cells.  These are cells that are used to select from a list of  
      options.  Selection cells highlight one item at a time.  An item/option   
      must be highlighted before it can be selected.  Selection is made by      
      pressing the Enter key.                                                   
                                                                                
  4.  Moving Between Cells.  The user can move from one input screen to         
      another, by pressing the Page Down key for the next screen or Page Up     
      key for the previous screen in the loop of primary or secondary screens.  
      Input screens are arranged in a loop format such that if the Page Down    
      key is pressed from the last input screen the control will return to the  
      first screen, and vice versa.  The up and down arrows are used to move    
      up and down through the cells of a screen.  If the up arrow is pressed    
      from the first cell on the screen, control will transfer to the last      
      cell on the same screen, and vice versa.  The Tab and Shift-Tab keys can  
      be used to move to the right and to the left, respectively, among input   
      and selection cells that are located on the same line.  In addition, the  
      left and right arrows may used to move between selection cells that are   
      located on the same line.                                                 
                                                                                
  5.  Moving Within an Input Cell.  Each input cell is set to a given width     
      depending upon the type of information expected to be entered in that     
      cell.  The cursor will initially be located on the first character space  
      of the cell.  The left and right arrow keys may be used to move the       
      cursor to different spaces within the cell.  If a value is typed in the   
      first space of the cell, the cell contents will be deleted.  In order to  
      delete a character, move the cursor to character location and press the   
      Delete key or move the cursor to the space that is to the right of the    
      character and press the Backspace key.  A character can be inserted       
      between characters in an input cell by moving the cursor to the desired   
      position then pressing the Insert key.  The Insert key will shift all     
      characters that are at and to the right of the cursor one position to     
      the right.                                                                
                                                                                
  6.  Terminating.  At any time during the session, the user may press the F9   
      key to quit without saving changes, return to the main menu and exit the  
      program.  The Esc key as well as the Ctrl-Break keys will end some        
      options and allow you to continue with other operations.  The F10 key is  
      used to save the data.  If necessary, the user can terminate input or     
      execution by rebooting (Ctrl-Alt-Del keys), resetting or turning off the  
      computer.  The user is discouraged from terminating a run in these        
      manners because some of the data may be lost.                             
                                                                                
  7.  On-Line Help.  On-line help is available to the user from any cell        
      location on the screen.  By pressing F1 information about the operations  
      and purpose of the screen is displayed, and by pressing F2 specific       
      technical assistance for the highlighted cell is displayed.  The F3 key   
      displays various functions of keystrokes.  Other specific information of  
      the input screen is listed in menu line(s) at the bottom of screen.       
                                                                                
  8.  System of Units.  Throughout the HELP program the user is required to     
      select a system of units.  The HELP model allows the user to use either   
      the customary system of units (a mixture of U.S. and metric units         
      traditionally used in landfill design and in Version 2 of the HELP        
      model) or the Metric system of units.  The user is not restricted to the  
      same system for all data types; for example, the soil and design data     
      can be in one system of units and the weather data can be in the other    
      system.  Moreover, it is not necessary for all types of weather data to   
      have the same system of units, i.e. evapotranspiration data may be in     
      the Metric system of units while precipitation data can be in customary   
      units; the solar radiation data can be in customary units while           
      temperature data can be Metric units, and so on.  Appropriate units are   
      displayed in proper locations to keep the user aware of which units       
      should be used for each data entry.  Consistency in units is only         
      required within each data type.                                           
                                                                                
4.3  PROGRAM STRUCTURE                                                          
                                                                                
       The flow or logic of the input facility of the HELP program may be       
  viewed as a tree structure.  The tree structure is made up of nodes which     
  are the points where new branches of the tree are started.  The first node    
  is called the trunk, root or parent node, and the terminal nodes of the tree  
  are called leaves.  All components (nodes) of the tree structure in the HELP  
  model are screens that have different functions as defined previously, with   
  the trunk node being the Main Menu.  During an input session, the user        
  should reach the leaf node if all the data for a given branch (module) are    
  entered.  Some of the nodes (screens) are common to more than one branch.     
  The user must return to the node where the branch started in order to go to   
  another branch.  These movements are made simple by using the special keys    
  discussed above such as Page Up, Page Down, F9, F10, etc.                     
                                                                                
4.4  THE MAIN MENU                                                              
                                                                                
       When the program is started, the Main Menu is displayed.  A schematic    
  of the main menu in Figure 3 shows the seven available modules (branches).    
  Selection from the main menu is made by either moving the cursor to the       
  desired module or by pressing the number of that option.  Once a selection    
  is made, program control transfers into an environment specific of that       
  option and cannot transfer to another main menu option without exiting that   
  environment to the main menu and then selecting another option.  A brief      
  description of each main menu option is presented below.  More details are    
  given in the following sections about specific data requirements for each     
  option.                                                                       
                                                                                
       Option 1 on the main menu is "Enter/Edit Weather Data."  This module     
  permits the user to read evapotranspiration, precipitation, temperature, and  
  solar radiation data files and then review, edit, and save the data or        
  create new files.  There are four primary screens in this module; they are a  
  file selection screen, evapotranspiration data screen, a screen that          
  controls the method used for specifying precipitation, temperature and solar  
  radiation data, and a screen for saving weather data files.  Several options  
  are available for specifying precipitation, temperature and solar radiations  
  data.  These vary from using default data (for precipitation only) to         
  synthetic and other user-defined data sources, such as NOAA Tape,             
  Climatedata, ASCII data, HELP Version 2 data, and Canadian Climatological     
  data.  Data may also be entered manually.  Default and synthetic weather      
  data generation is performed by selecting the city of interest from a list    
  of cities and specifying (optional) additional data.                          
                                                                                
       Option 2 on the main menu is "Enter/Edit Soil and Design Data."  This    
  module allows the user to read an already existing soil and design data file  
  and then review, edit, and save the data or create a new data file.  There    
  are eight primary screens in the soil and design data module; they are a      
  file selection screen, a landfill general information screen, three screens   
  for entering design, soil and geomembrane liner data by layers, a screen for  
  entering a runoff curve number, a data verification screen and a screen for   
  saving the soil and design data file.  Input screens associated with this     
  module provide cells for entering project title; system of units; initial     
  soil conditions; landfill area; layer design information such as layer type,  
  thickness, soil texture, drainage characteristics; geomembrane liner          
  information; and runoff curve number information including the ability to     
  adjust the curve number as a function of surface slope and length.  At the    
  end of this module the user may request that the data be checked for          
  possible violation of the design rules explained in Section 3.  Under this    
  module, the HELP model verifies the design data, soil and geomembrane liner   
  properties and layer arrangement.                                             
                                                                                
       Option 3 on the main menu is "Execute Simulation."  In this option the   
  user defines the data files to be used in running the simulation component    
  of the HELP model and selects the output frequency and simulation duration    
  desired from execution.  In this option the user can also view the list of    
  files available and can make file selections from these lists.                
                                                                                
       Option 4 on the main menu is "View Results."  This option allows the     
  user to browse through the output file in order to examine the results of     
  the run after executing the program.  Option 5 is "Print Results," and        
  Option 6 is "Display Guidance" on general landfill design procedures and on   
  the HELP model itself, containing much of the text of this user guide.        
  Finally, Option 7 is to "Quit" the HELP model and return to DOS.
