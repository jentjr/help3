#UNITS                                                                          
                                                                                
  8.  System of Units.  Throughout the HELP program the user is required to     
      select a system of units.  The HELP model allows the user to use either   
      the customary system of units (a mixture of U.S. and metric units         
      traditionally used in landfill design and in Version 2 of the HELP        
      model) or the Metric system of units.  The user is not restricted to the  
      same system for all data types; for example, the soil and design data     
      can be in one system of units and the weather data can be in the other    
      system.  Moreover, it is not necessary for all types of weather data to   
      have the same system of units, i.e. evapotranspiration data may be in     
      the Metric system of units while precipitation data can be in customary   
      units; the solar radiation data can be in customary units while           
      temperature data can be Metric units, and so on.  Appropriate units are   
      displayed in proper locations to keep the user aware of which units       
      should be used for each data entry.  Consistency in units is only         
      required within each data type.

  4.5.1  WEATHER DATA FILE SELECTION                                            
                                                                                
       The first screen in the weather data module is the "Weather Data - File  
  Editing" screen.  A schematic of this screen is shown in Figure 5.  On this   
  screen the user may enter file names of existing files to select previously   
  generated HELP Version 3 files for editing or leave the file names blank to   
  create new data.  One file name for each of the four types of weather data    
  to be edited is needed.  The DOS path may be specified if different from the  
  active or default drive and subdirectory, such as C:\HELP3\DATA.  The         
  following gives file naming and extension information.

     *  Any valid DOS name that the user desires (up to eight characters) is    
        acceptable.  The HELP program supplies the extension.                   
                                                                                
  This convention must be always remembered when selecting file names for       
  editing, saving, or converting data from other sources.  However, when        
  typing a file name on this screen, the user should not enter the extension    
  since the program automatically assigns the proper extension to the file      
  according to the weather types.                                               
                                                                                
       The current directory is displayed on the screen.  The user may obtain   
  a listing of all data files that reside on the current directory by pressing  
  F4.  By pressing F4, the program obtains a directory of all files that        
  pertain to the weather data cell from which F4 was pressed.  For example, if  
  F4 was pressed from the temperature file cell, the program will display the   
  list of files with an extension of D7 that reside on the currently specified  
  directory.  Up to 120 data files for any weather data type can be displayed   
  on the screen.  The name of the current directory where these files are       
  located is also displayed.  To obtain the data files pertaining to the        
  weather information needed that reside in another directory, the user should  
  type in the name of a valid drive and subdirectory in the Directory column    
  and then press F4 for the list of files in that subdirectory.  To display a   
  directory for another type of data, move the cursor to the row for that data  
  type and repeat the process listed above.                                     
                                                                                
       To select a file from the list of displayed files, move the cursor to    
  the desired file name and press Enter.  This action transfers control back    
  to the previous screen, and the name of the file just selected will be        
  displayed in the proper cell.  The user can exit the "Data Files" screen      
  without selecting a file by pressing the Esc key.                             
                                                                                
       File names may also be typed in the proper cell.  If the program cannot  
  find the file name as entered, the message "FILE NOT FOUND" will be           
  displayed.  The previously entered file name is erased and the user has       
  another opportunity to enter a correct file name.  The user must first enter  
  the correct directory name before entering the file name.  If an invalid      
  directory is entered, the program will display the message, "INVALID          
  DIRECTORY," and replace the entered directory name with the default           
  directory name (where the program was started).  The user then has another    
  opportunity to enter the correct directory name.  Pressing Page Down causes   
  the program to read the valid data files selected and then proceeds to the    
  first weather data entry screen.

  4.5.2  EVAPOTRANSPIRATION (ET) DATA                                           
                                                                                
       The evapotranspiration data requirements are listed in Section 3 and     
  are entered to the program from the "Evapotranspiration Data" screen.  This   
  screen contains all information required by the HELP model to construct the   
  evapotranspiration data file (*.D11).  If the user specified an edit file     
  name for the evapotranspiration data, the contents of the file will be        
  displayed in the appropriate cells on this screen.  The user can move the     
  cursor to any cell to edit its contents.  However, if no file was selected    
  as an edit file, then data must be specified by the user.  First, the user    
  must select the system of units to be used for the ET data.  The              
  evapotranspiration data may be entered in customary or metric units as        
  explained in a previous section.  A schematic of this screen is shown in      
  Figure 6.  The two methods for entering this data are the manual option and   
  the default option.                                                           
                                                                                
#ETLOCATION                                                                     
                                                                                
  Manual Option                                                                 
                                                                                
       This is option requires the user to enter all evapotranspiration data    
  manually.  The user should first specify a location in the form of a city,    
  state and latitude (negative values should be used to indicate locations      
  in the southern hemisphere), followed by the evaporative zone depth, the      
  maximum leaf area index, the Julian dates of the start (planting) and end     
  (harvest) of the growing season, the annual average wind speed, and           
  quarterly average relative humidities (in percentages) for the entered        
  location.  The location is used only as documentation of the source of        
  evapotranspiration data.  The latitude is used for snowmelt and frozen soil   
  submodels.                                                                    
                                                                                
  Default Option                                                                
                                                                                
       This option takes advantage of an available list of cities for which     
  default values are provided for most of the evapotranspiration data;          
  guidance information is available for the rest of the data.  This option is   
  triggered from any input cell on the "Evapotranspiration Data" screen by      
  pressing F5 and selecting a location (state and city) from a list of          
  locations.  This list of cities is the same as that in Table 3.               
                                                                                
       Once a city is selected, the program automatically displays values in    
  the appropriate input cells for the city, state, latitude, growing season     
  dates, wind speed, and the four quarterly humidity values for that location.  
  The program, however, displays guidance information on the evaporative zone   
  depth for that location depending on the vegetative cover.  The user must     
  enter a value of the evaporative zone depth that is appropriate for the       
  landfill design, location, top soil and vegetation.  (See Section 3 for       
  detailed guidance.)                                                           
#ETLOCATION                                                                     
                                                                                
       The user must also enter a value for the maximum leaf area index for     
  the site.  If the value entered is greater than the default maximum           
  allowable value based on the climate for the selected city, the program will  
  display that value only as a guidance to the user.  The user is not forced    
  to change the entered value.                                                  
                                                                                
       If the user decides to edit the name of the city or state, the program   
  will erase the guidance information.  Guidance is only provided for cities    
  that are selected from the list obtained by pressing F5.                      
                                                                                
       It is highly likely that the location of the landfill being evaluated    
  is some distance from all of the listed cities.  In this case the user has    
  the option to select a city that has an similar climate and edit the values   
  to improve the data or to simply enter the information manually.              
                                                                                
       The bottom line of the "Evapotranspiration Data" screen provides         
  additional help information.  Once all data are entered, the user can move    
  on to another screen by pressing Page Up or Page Down, return to the main     
  menu by pressing F9, or proceed to save the evapotranspiration data by        
  pressing F10.                                                                 
                                                                                
#ET                                                                             
#ZONEDEPTH                                                                      
                                                                                
      *  Evaporative zone depth.  The user must specify an evaporative zone     
         depth and can use the guidance given under the default option along    
         with specific design information to select a value.  The program does  
         not permit the evaporative depth to exceed the depth to the top of     
         the topmost barrier soil layer.  Similarly, the evaporative zone       
         depth would not be expected to extend very far into a sand drainage    
         layer.  The evaporative zone depth must be greater than zero.  The     
         evaporative zone depth is the maximum depth from which water may be    
         removed by evapotranspiration.  The value specified influences the     
         storage of water near the surface and therefore directly affects the   
         computations for evapotranspiration and runoff.  Where surface         
         vegetation is present, the evaporative depth should at least equal     
         the expected average depth of root penetration.  The influence of      
         plant roots usually extends somewhat below the depth of root           
         penetration because of capillary suction to the roots.  The depth      
         specified should be characteristic of the maximum depth to which the   
         moisture changes near the surface due to drying over the course of a   
         year, typically occurring during peak evaporative demand or when peak  
         quantity of vegetation is present.  Setting the evaporative depth      
         equal to the expected average root depth would tend to yield a low     
         estimate of evapotranspiration and a high estimate of drainage         
         through the evaporative zone.  An evaporative depth should be          
         specified for bare ground to account for direct evaporation from the   
         soil; this depth would be a function of the soil type and vapor and    
         heat flux at the surface.  The depth of capillary draw to the surface  
         without vegetation or to the root zone may be only several inches in   
         gravels; in sands the depth may be about 4 to 8 inches, in silts       
         about 8 to 18 inches, and in clays about 12 to 60 inches.  Rooting     
         depth is dependent on manner factors -- species, moisture              
         availability, maturation, soil type and plant density.  In humid       
         areas where moisture is readily available near the surface, grasses    
         may have rooting depth of 6 to 24 inches.  In drier areas, the         
         rooting depth is very sensitive to plant species and to the depth to   
         which moisture is stored and may range from 6 to 48 inches.  The       
         evaporative zone depth would be somewhat greater than the rooting      
         depth.  Local agricultural extension services can provide information  
         on characteristic rooting depths for vegetation in specific areas.

#LAI                                                                            
                                                                                
      *  Maximum leaf area index.  The user must enter a maximum value of leaf  
         area index for the vegetative cover.  Leaf area index (LAI) is         
         defined as the dimensionless ratio of the leaf area of actively        
         transpiring vegetation to the nominal surface area of the land on      
         which the vegetation is growing.  The program provides the user with   
         a maximum LAI value typical of the location selected if the value      
         entered by the user cannot be supported without irrigation because of  
         low rainfall or a short growing season.  This statement should be      
         considered only as a warning.  The maximum LAI for bare ground is      
         zero.  For a poor stand of grass the LAI could approach 1.0; for a     
         fair stand of grass, 2.0; for a good stand of grass, 3.5; and for an   
         excellent stand of grass, 5.0.  The LAI for dense stands of trees and  
         shrubbery would also approach 5.  The program is largely insensitive   
         to values above 5.  If the vegetative species limit plant              
         transpiration (such as succulent plants), the maximum LAI value should 
         be reduced to a value equivalent of the LAI for a stand of grass that  
         would yield a similar quantity of plant transpiration.  Most           
         landfills would tend to have at best a fair stand of grass and often   
         only a poor stand of grass because landfills are not designed as       
         ideal support systems for vegetative growth.  Surface soils are        
         commonly shallow and provide little moisture storage for dry periods.  
         Many covers may have drains to remove infiltrated water quickly,       
         reducing moisture storage.  Some covers have liners near the surface   
         restricting root penetration and causing frequent saturation of the    
         surface soil which limits oxygen availability to the roots.  Some      
         landfills produce large quantities of gas which, if uncontrolled,      
         reduces the oxygen availability in the rooting zone and therefore      
         limits plant growth.                                                   
#LAI                                                                            
#SEASON                                                                         
                                                                                
      *  Dates starting and ending the growing season.  The start of the        
         growing season is based on mean daily temperature and plant species.   
         Typically, the start of the growing season for grasses is the Julian   
         date (day of the year) when the normal mean daily temperature rises    
         above 50 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit.  The growing season ends when the   
         normal mean daily temperatures falls below 50 to 55 degrees            
         Fahrenheit.  In cooler climates the start and end would be at lower    
         temperatures and in warmer climates at higher temperatures.  Data on   
         normal mean daily temperature is available from "Climate of the        
         States" reference books and the "Climatic Atlas of the United States"  
         published by National Climate Center of NOAA.  In locations where the  
         growing season extends year-round, the start of the growing season     
         should be reported as day 0 and the end as day 367.  The values for    
         the growing season should be check carefully to agree with the         
         germination and harvesting (end of seasonal growth) dates for your     
         type of vegetation.  For example, grasses in southern California       
         would germinate in the fall when the rains occur and die off in late   
         spring when the soil moisture is depleted.  This contrasts with a      
         typical growing season which would start in the spring and end in the  
         fall.

      *  Normal average annual wind speed.  This data is available from NOAA    
         annual climatological data summary, "Climate of the States" reference  
         books and the "Climatic Atlas of the United States."  Sensitivity      
         tests showed that most of the effects of wind speed on monthly,        
         annual and long-term average water balances are captured by using the  
         normal average annual wind speed, limiting the need for more detailed  
         wind speed data.

         reference books and the "Climatic Atlas of the United States."         
         Sensitivity tests showed that most of the effects of humidity on       
         monthly, annual and long-term average water balances are captured by   
         using the normal average quarterly relative humidity, limiting the     
         need for more detailed humidity data.

  4.5.3  PRECIPITATION, TEMPERATURE AND SOLAR RADIATION DATA                    
                                                                                
       The second screen in the weather data module is entitled                 
  "Precipitation, Temperature and Solar Radiation."  From this screen the user  
  can select methods for creating the precipitation data file (*.D4), the       
  temperature data file (*.D7), and the solar radiation data file (*.D13).  A   
  schematic of the main options available on this screen are shown in Figure    
  7.  In Version 3 of the HELP Model all of the weather data need not be        
  generated by the same method.  For example, the user can enter the            
  precipitation data using the synthetic weather generator, the temperature     
  data using data from a NOAA data file, and solar radiation from an ASCII      
  file.  Seven options are available for entering temperature and solar         
  radiation data.  Under the precipitation data there are the same seven plus   
  a default option.  Figures 8, 9, and 10 show the possible options.            
                                                                                
#WEATHER                                                                        
#DEFAULT                                                                        
                                                                                
       If the default precipitation option (Customary Units Only) is selected,  
  the program will prompt the user with the list of states having default       
  data.  The HELP model provides default precipitation values for the list of   
  cities in Table 2.  To select a state, move the cursor to the desired state   
  name and press Enter.  At this time the program prompts the user with the     
  list of cities in the selected state for which default precipitation data is  
  available.  Similarly, the city can be selected by moving the cursor to the   
  desired city and pressing Enter.  The user can return back to the             
  "Precipitation, Temperature and Solar Radiation" screen from either list by   
  pressing Esc.  By doing so, neither a city nor a state is considered          
  selected.  However, once a city is selected, the program reads the five       
  years of default precipitation data for the selected city.  The usefulness    
  of the default precipitation option is limited since it contains only five    
  years of precipitation data.  It is additionally limiting since these five    
  years may be dry or wet years and may not be representative of the site in    
  question.                                                                     
                                                                                
  1.  Default Precipitation Option (Customary Units).  The user may select      
      five years of historic precipitation data for any of the 102 U.S. cities  
      listed in Table 2.  The input needed for this option is:                  
                                                                                
      *  Location                                                               
                                                                                
         NOTE:  The user should be aware of the limitations of using the        
         default historical precipitation data.  None of the 102 locations for  
         which data is available may be representative of the study site since  
         rainfall is spatially very variable.  In addition, the five years for  
         which default data are available (1974-1978 in most cases) may not     
         have been typical, but were unusually wet or dry.  It is therefore     
         highly recommended that the user examine the rainfall and determine    
         how representative it is of normal, wet and dry years at the study     
         site.  It is also recommended that the simulation be run for more      
         than five years to determine long-term performance of the landfill     
         using, if  necessary, one of the other precipitation input options to  
         examine the design under the range of possible weather conditions.     
                                                                                
#DEFAULT                                                                        
#SYNTHETIC                                                                      
                                                                                
       The second available method for entering precipitation data is to use    
  the synthetic weather generator (Customary or Metric Units).  This is the     
  first method for entering temperature and solar radiation data.  This option  
  can be selected for temperature and solar radiation only if the user has      
  previously entered precipitation data since the synthetic weather generator   
  requires precipitation values for generating both temperature and solar       
  radiation.  By selecting the synthetic data option, the program prompts the   
  user with a list of states for which it has synthetic weather data            
  coefficients.  Again the user can move the cursor to the appropriate state    
  and press Enter to obtain the list of cities in that state for which          
  synthetic data can be generated.  From this list, the user can select the     
  city where the project is located or a city whose climate resembles the       
  climate where the project is located.  This is done again by moving the       
  cursor to the selection cell highlighting the desired city and pressing       
  Enter.  At any time, the user may abandon the input for the synthetic         
  weather generator by pressing Esc; the program will return to the             
  "Precipitation, Temperature and Solar Radiation" screen without loss of       
  previously entered data.                                                      
                                                                                
       Once a city is selected, the program displays another screen called      
  "Synthetic Precipitation Data", "Synthetic Temperature Data" or "Synthetic    
  Solar Radiation Data."  On this screen, the city and state are displayed,     
  and the user is asked to provide additional information.  The first value     
  that must be entered is the number of years of synthetic data to be           
  generated.  The rest of the information on the screen is optional.  For       
  precipitation the user has the option to use the default normal mean monthly  
  precipitation values provided by the HELP program or to enter normal mean     
  monthly precipitation values to be used in generating the synthetic           
  precipitation for that location.  For temperature the user has the option to  
  use the default normal mean monthly temperature values provided by the HELP   
  program or to enter normal mean monthly temperature values to be used in      
  generating the synthetic temperature for that location.  Users are            
  encouraged to enter their own normal mean monthly values especially if the    
  landfill is not located at the selected city.  The program uses the normal    
  mean monthly data to adjust the data generated by the synthetic weather       
  generator.  If the user decides not to use the default values, the program    
  will transfer control to the normal mean monthly data option under the        
  "User" heading.  At this time the user must input values for January through  
  December.  A blank cell for a given month will be recorded as zero, and the   
  user must be careful not to leave a cell without an entry.  A zero entry,     
  however, is a valid entry.  For solar radiation the optional value is the     
  latitude for the location.  The default latitude of the selected city will    
  be displayed, but the user is encouraged to enter the latitude of the actual  
  landfill location to obtain better solar radiation values.  Negative values   
  should be used to indicate locations in the southern hemisphere.              
                                                                                
  1.  Synthetic Precipitation Option (Customary or Metric Units).  The program  
      will generate from 1 to 100 years of daily precipitation data             
      stochastically for the selected location using a synthetic weather        
      generator.  The synthetic precipitation data will have approximately the  
      same statistical characteristics as the historic data at the selected     
      location.  If desired, the user can enter normal mean monthly             
      precipitation values for the specific location to improve the             
      statistical characteristics of the resulting daily values.  The user is   
      advised to enter normal mean monthly precipitation values if the project  
      site is located some distance from the city selected from Table 3.  The   
      daily values will vary from month to month and from year to year and      
      will not equal the normal values entered.  The same data is produced      
      every time the option is used for a given location.  The data required    
      by the synthetic weather generator are:                                   
                                                                                
      *  Location (select from a list of 139 U.S. cities in Table 3)            
                                                                                
      *  Number of years of data to be generated                                
                                                                                
      *  Normal mean monthly precipitation (Optional, default values are        
         available.)                                                            
                                                                                
  2.  Synthetic Temperature Option (Customary or Metric Units).  The program    
      will generate from 1 to 100 years of temperature data stochastically for  
      the selected location.  The synthetic generation of daily temperature     
      values is a weak function of precipitation and as such the user must      
      first specify the precipitation.  Generation of temperature data is       
      limited to the number of years of precipitation data available.  The      
      synthetic temperature data will have approximately the same statistical   
      characteristics as the historic data at the selected location.  If        
      desired, the user can enter normal mean monthly temperature values for    
      the specific location to improve the statistical characteristics of the   
      resulting daily values.  The user is advised to enter normal mean         
      monthly temperature values if the project site is located some distance   
      from the city selected from Table 1.  The data required by the synthetic  
      weather generator are:                                                    
                                                                                
      *  Location (select from a list of 183 U.S. cities in Table 1)            
                                                                                
      *  Number of years of data to be generated                                
                                                                                
      *  Years of daily precipitation values                                    
                                                                                
      *  Normal mean monthly temperature (Optional, default values are          
         available.)                                                            
                                                                                
  3.  Synthetic Solar Radiation Option (Customary or Metric Units).  The        
      program will generate from 1 to 100 years of daily solar radiation data   
      stochastically for the selected location.  The synthetic generation of    
      daily solar radiation values is a strong function of precipitation and    
      as such the user must first specify the precipitation.  Generation of     
      solar radiation data is limited to the number of years of precipitation   
      data available.  The synthetic solar radiation data will have nearly the  
      same statistical characteristics as the historic data at the selected     
      location.  If desired, the user can enter the latitude for the specific   
      location to improve the computation of potential solar radiation and

       If the user selects the create/edit option (Customary or Metric Units)   
  for manually entering or editing precipitation, temperature and/or solar      
  radiation data, the program prompts the user with a request to enter the      
  city and state of the location and the units that will be used for entering   
  the data manually.  These requests appear on the same screen as               
  "Precipitation, Temperature and Solar Radiation" screen and will be filled    
  in with information when editing an existing data file.  The user may press   
  the Esc key to abandon the entry of this information and return to the        
  selection of another weather data option.  Once the location and units are    
  specified, the program displays the yearly data screen to rearrange, copy or  
  delete years of data or specify years of daily data to edit or add.  The      
  daily data screen is displayed for editing and entering daily data.           
                                                                                
  1.  Create/Edit Precipitation Option (Customary or Metric Units).  Under      
      the Create option, the user may enter from 1 to 100 years of daily        
      precipitation data manually.  The years, which need not be consecutive,   
      can be entered in any order.  The user may add or delete years of data    
      or rearrange the order of the years of data.  This same option can be     
      used to edit the daily values of any year of data; commonly, this is      
      used add to severe storm events, such as the 25-yr, 24-hr precipitation   
      event.  The data required are:

  2.  Create/Edit Temperature Option (Customary or Metric Units).  Under the    
      create option, the user may enter up to 100 years of daily temperature    
      data manually.  The years, which need not be consecutive, can be entered  
      in any order.  The user may add or delete years of data or rearrange the  
      order of the years of data.  This same option can be used to edit the     
      daily values of any year of data.  The data required are:

      *  One or more years of daily temperature data                            
                                                                                
  3.  Create/Edit Solar Radiation Option (Customary or Metric Units).  Under    
      the create option, the user may enter up to 100 years of daily solar      
      radiation data manually.  The years, which need not be consecutive, can   
      be entered in any order.  The user may add or delete years of data or     
      rearrange the order of the years of data.  This same option can be used   
      to edit the daily values of any year of data.  The data required are:

  Yearly Data Screen                                                            
                                                                                
       This screen is like a spreadsheet that has four columns.  Two of these   
  columns are for the precipitation data, and one column each is for            
  temperature and solar radiation. The first column is for the year for which   
  the precipitation data is to be entered, and the second column is for that    
  year's total precipitation.  The user cannot access the yearly total          
  precipitation column since this total is computed by the program after the    
  daily data for the year is entered.  If the user reaches this screen from     
  the precipitation option on the "Precipitation, Temperature, and Solar        
  Radiation" screen, the user will only be able to move within the column       
  under precipitation.  Similarly, if the user reaches this screen from the     
  temperature data option, then only movement in the temperature column is      
  permitted, and analogously for the solar radiation option.                    
                                                                                
       To enter a new year of daily values, the user should move the cursor to  
  a empty cell, type in the year and press Enter.  The program will display     
  the daily data screen on which the daily values are entered.  The user can    
  return to the yearly data screen by pressing F10 to retain the data (to a     
  temporary file) or by pressing Esc to abandon the created data.               
                                                                                
       The user can enter up to 100 years of daily data.  The yearly data       
  screen can only display 20 rows at a time.  The user, however, can move the   
  cursor to the bottom of the screen and press the down arrow to move to the    
  next row until the 100th row is displayed.  Similarly, the user can move the  
  cursor upward to display the rows in the spreadsheet that are not shown on    
  the screen, if any.  To move down 20 rows, press Page Down, and to move up    
  20 rows, press Page Up.  To reach the last row, press End, and to go to the   
  first row press Home.                                                         
                                                                                
       To edit an existing year of daily values, the user must first create     
  and/or read the weather data.  If the data was previously saved, the user     
  should specified the existing data file "Weather Data - File Editing" screen  
  immediately after selecting the "Enter/Edit Weather Data" option from the     
  main menu.  The HELP model reads the data from the edit file and stores it    
  in a temporary file.  Upon entering the create/edit option, the program       
  displays the list of years for precipitation, the total annual precipitation  
  for each year, and a list of years for the temperature and solar radiation    
  data.  To edit, move the cursor to the year that is to be edited and press    
  Enter.  The program will display the daily data screen and the user may       
  typeover any values that needs to be edited.  The operation of the yearly     
  data spreadsheet and the daily data spreadsheet is the same as for creating   
  new data.                                                                     
                                                                                
       After entering or editing years of daily weather data, the user can      
  return to the "Precipitation, Temperature and Solar Radiation" screen to      
  exercise other weather data options.  To retain the newly created or edited   
  years of daily weather data, the user should press F10 from the yearly data   
  screen; the program will replace the existing temporary data file containing  
  all of the years of data for that type of weather data.  To lose the newly    
  entered or edited daily data, the user should press F9 or Esc; the program    
  will retain the previously existing temporary data file containing the        
  values of that type of weather data prior to entering the create/edit         
  option.                                                                       
                                                                                
  Daily Data Screen                                                             
                                                                                
       Upon selecting or specifying a year from the yearly data screen, the     
  program displays the daily data screen which is a spreadsheet for entering    
  daily data.  This spreadsheet is composed of 10 columns and 37 rows.  The     
  spreadsheet contains information on the file name, the year, month and day.   
  This information is displayed at the top of the spreadsheet.  The day and     
  month are continuously updated as the user moves from one cell to another.    
  The first day is considered January 1, and the last day is December 31.  The  
  spreadsheet is divided into two parts; the first part is composed of rows 1   
  through 19, and the second part contains rows 20 through 37.  The user can    
  move the cursor to the bottom of the screen and press the down arrow to move  
  to the next row until the 37th row is displayed.  Similarly, the user can     
  move the cursor upward (up arrow) to display the rows in the spreadsheet      
  that are not shown on the screen, if any.  To move from the upper to the      
  lower portions of the spreadsheet and vice versa,  press Page Down and  Page  
  Up, respectively.  To reach the last cell in the spreadsheet, press End, and  
  to return to the first cell, press Home.                                      
                                                                                
       The user should input values one day at a time without leaving empty     
  cells between months.  For example, the first month (January) will extend to  
  the first cell (or column) in the fourth row.  The values for the first day   
  in February should start in column 2 of row 4; no empty cells are left        
  between months.  An empty cell is considered by the program to indicate a     
  value of zero for that day.  A zero is a valid entry.  The program keeps      
  track of leap years and adjusts the month and day at the top of the           
  spreadsheet accordingly.  Since there are 37 lines with each line containing  
  10 days of data, there will be empty cells at the end of line 37 in the       
  spreadsheet.  These cells are ignored by the program.                         
                                                                                
       If the user decides to quit entering data in the daily spreadsheet and   
  return to the yearly spreadsheet, the user should press the Esc key.  By      
  doing so, whatever data was entered on the daily data sheet will be lost;     
  the previously existing data will be retained.  To exit the daily             
  spreadsheet and retain the data entered on that sheet, the user should press  
  F10.  It is important to note that the F10 key will retain the data in a      
  temporary file only and not in any previously selected file.  A separate      
  temporary file is maintained for each year of daily data.                     
                                                                                
       Once the user returns to the yearly weather sheet, more years can be     
  entered or edited and the daily values for these years can be input on the    
  daily sheet in the same manner described above.  If the user has been         
  working in the precipitation spreadsheet, after entering the daily            
  precipitation values for the year and pressing F10, upon returning to the     
  yearly sheet, the annual total precipitation for that year is computed and    
  displayed next to the year.                                                   
                                                                                
  Editing Data on Yearly Data Screen                                            
                                                                                
       Besides selecting years for creating or editing daily data, the user     
  has the options on the yearly data screen to select only a portion of a       
  weather file for future use, to rearrange the years of data, to repeat the    
  same year(s) of data for a longer simulation period or to insert years of     
  data into an existing file.  These options are performed using the functions  
  to add (insert) a year above or below an existing year, delete a year, move   
  a year to a position above or below an existing year, or copy a year to a     
  position above or below an existing year.  The options are performed only on  
  the type of data (precipitation, temperature or solar radiation) highlighted  
  when the create/edit option was selected.  This is done by using the          
  following key combinations of functions:                                      
                                                                                
       Alt A  adds/inserts a year (either new, being moved or being copied)     
              above the highlighted year (where the cursor is positioned)       
                                                                                
       Alt B  adds/inserts a year (either new, being moved or being copied)     
              below the highlighted year (where the cursor is positioned)       
                                                                                
       Alt D  deletes the highlighted year (where the cursor is positioned)     
                                                                                
       Alt M  tags the highlighted year (where the cursor is positioned) to be  
              moved to another location to be designated using the cursor and   
              Alt A or Alt B                                                    
                                                                                
       Alt C  tags the highlighted year (where the cursor is positioned) to     
              be copied to another location to be designated using the cursor   
              and Alt A or Alt B                                                
                                                                                
       To add a new year directly above a certain year, for example above the   
  year on line 29 (shown on the left edge of the screen), the user should move  
  the cursor to line 29, hold the Alt key down, and press A.  The result of     
  this action is that a blank cell is inserted above line 29, and the program   
  shifts the year on line 29 and all the years below it one line downward       
  (i.e. year on line 29 moves to line 30, year on line 30 moves to line 31,     
  etc.), and line 29 will be a blank line for the user to enter the value for   
  the new year.                                                                 
                                                                                
       To add a year directly below a certain year, for example below the year  
  on line 5, the user should move the cursor to line 5, hold the Alt key down,  
  and press B.  The result of this action is that a blank cell is inserted      
  below line 5, and the program shifts the year on line 6 and all the years     
  below it one line downward (i.e. year on line 6 moves to line 7, year on      
  line 7 moves to line 8, etc.), and line 6 will be a blank cell for the user   
  to enter the value of the new year.                                           
                                                                                
       The Alt D combination causes the program to delete a year from the list  
  of years.  As an example, to delete the year on line 15, the user should      
  move the cursor to line 15, hold the Alt key down, and press D.  The program  
  will delete the information on line 15 and will shift the years on lines 16   
  to 100 upward one line (i.e. year on line 16 moves to line 15, year on line   
  17 moves to line 16, etc.), and cell on line 100 becomes an empty cell.  The  
  user is cautioned that the deleted year cannot be recovered without quitting  
  and losing all changes (F9 or Esc).  The original temporary file is replaced  
  only when the changes are finally retained by pressing F10 from the yearly    
  data screen.                                                                  
                                                                                
       The copy command allows the user to place a year that is identical to    
  another year on another line.  For example, to copy the year on line 70 to    
  line 5, move the cursor to line 70 and press the Alt C combination, then      
  move the cursor to line 5 and press the Alt A combination.  At this point     
  the user must specify a value for the new year; the value must be different   
  from the value of any other year in the data set for that type of weather     
  data.  This action will cause the new value for the year to appear on line 5  
  but the daily values will be the same as those found for the year copied and  
  previously found in line 70.  (The user may obtain the same result after the  
  Alt C combination by moving to line 4 and pressing the combination Alt B).    
                                                                                
       The move command allows the user to move one year from one location on   
  the yearly data screen to another.  For example, to move the year on line 32  
  above the year on line 56, move the cursor to line 32, press the Alt M        
  combination, and move the cursor to line 56 and press the Alt A combination.  
  This action will cause the year on line 32 to be deleted and be placed        
  directly above the year on line 56.  (The user may obtain the same result     
  after the Alt M combination by moving to line 55 and pressing the             
  combination Alt B).                                                           
                                                                                
       The Esc key can be used to quit the move and copy functions (after       
  pressing Alt M or Alt C and before pressing Alt A or Alt B.  By editing the   
  data as discussed above, the user is actually arranging the order of the      
  precipitation data of the years.  Actual rearranging of data in the data      
  file, however, takes place only after the user presses F10.

       The program requires both daily and normal mean monthly temperature      
  data.  The daily temperature data is used for modeling potential              
  evapotranspiration, daily plant growth and decay and frozen soil.  Normal     
  mean monthly temperature values are used to set up the normal seasonal        
  vegetative growth and decay cycle.  Normal mean monthly temperature values    
  are provided in the synthetic temperature data base.  Normal mean             
  temperatures may be specified or calculated from the daily values.            
#TEMPSELECT                                                                     
#NOAA                                                                           
                                                                                
       This option allows the user to enter data to the HELP model from a NOAA  
  data set (Customary Units Only).  If this option is selected, the user must   
  enter the city and state for the site and the NOAA file name.  For the        
  precipitation and temperature options, the NOAA data file should contain      
  daily Summary of Day data written in as-on-tape format.  Note that for        
  temperature data two file names are requested, one for the maximum            
  temperature and the other for the minimum temperature.  If the user has only  
  a mean temperature data file, the mean temperature data file name should be   
  entered for both maximum and minimum temperature data file names.  For the    
  solar radiation option the NOAA data file should contain hourly Surface       
  Airways data written in as-on-tape format.  Example NOAA data files are       
  included with the HELP program -- PC49215A.PRN for precipitation,             
  MX49215A.PRN for maximum temperature and MN49215A.PRN for minimum             
  temperature.  When entering the NOAA file name, the user should include the   
  DOS path (if the file location is different than the default directory),      
  file name and extension.  The user can abandon the entry of this data by      
  pressing Esc.  Once valid information is entered, the program reads the data  
  from the specified file and converts it to the HELP Version 3 format.         
                                                                                
  1.  NOAA Tape Precipitation Option (Customary Units).  The option will        
      convert the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)        
      Summary of Day daily precipitation data written to diskette in ASCII      
      print as-on-tape format into the format used by Version 3 of the HELP     
      model.  The following data are required for this option:                  
                                                                                
      *  Location                                                               
                                                                                
      *  NOAA ASCII print file of Summary of Day daily precipitation data in    
         as-on-tape format                                                      
                                                                                
  2.  NOAA Tape Temperature Option (Customary Units).  This option will         
      convert the NOAA Summary of Day daily temperature data written to         
      diskette in ASCII print as-on-tape format into the format used by         
      Version 3 of the HELP model.  The program will accept either mean daily   
      temperature or daily maximum and minimum temperature values.  If maximum  
      and minimum temperatures are used, the program merely averages the two    
      to compute the daily mean temperature value.  If mean temperature values  
      are used, the same file is specified as the maximum and minimum           
      temperature files.  The following data are required for this option:      
                                                                                
      *  Location                                                               
                                                                                
      *  NOAA ASCII print file of Summary of Day data file containing           
         containing years of daily maximum temperature values or daily mean     
         temperature values in as-on-tape format                                
                                                                                
      *  NOAA ASCII print file of Summary of Day data file containing           
         containing years of daily minimum temperature values or daily mean     
         temperature values in as-on-tape format                                
                                                                                
  3.  NOAA Tape Solar Radiation Option (Customary Units).  This option will     
      convert the NOAA Surface Airways Hourly solar radiation data written to   
      diskette in ASCII print as-on-tape format into the format used by         
      Version 3 of the HELP model.  The following data are required for this    
      option:                                                                   
                                                                                
      *  Location                                                               
                                                                                
      *  NOAA ASCII print file of Surface Airways Hourly solar radiation data   
         in as-on-tape format                                                   
                                                                                
         NOTE:  Daily precipitation data, normal mean monthly precipitation     
         values, daily temperature (mean or maximum and minimum) data and       
         normal mean monthly temperature values for most locations are readily  
         available in publications or on diskette from the National Oceanic     
         and Atmospheric Administration.  Hourly solar radiation data is        
         available for only a limited number of sites and usually only for a    
         short duration.  Solar radiation data will often have to be            
         supplemented with synthetically generated values.  Information on      
         climatological data sources can be obtained from the National          
         Climatic Data Center, NOAA, Federal Building, Asheville, NC 28801,     
         (704) 259-0682.                                                        
#NOAA                                                                           
#LOCATION                                                                       
                                                                                
       The location is used only as documentation of the source of the weather  
  data.  It consists of a city and state, but other information about the       
  source of the data in import files could be specified instead; for example,   
  station number or location such as airport.                                   
#LOCATION                                                                       
#IMPORTFILES                                                                    
                                                                                
       When entering the import file name, the user should include the DOS      
  path (if the file location is different than the default directory), file     
  name and extension.  The user can abandon the entry of this data by pressing  
  Esc.  Once valid information is entered, the program reads the data from the  
  specified file and converts it to the HELP Version 3 format.                  
#IMPORTFILES                                                                    
#CLIMATEDATA                                                                    
                                                                                
       This option allows the user to import daily precipitation, temperature   
  or solar radiation data to the HELP model from Climatedata (Customary Units   
  Only).  If this option is selected, the user must enter the city and state    
  for the site and the Climatedata file name.  Note that for temperature data   
  two file names are requested, one for the maximum temperature file and the    
  other for the minimum temperature file.  The Climatedata file should have     
  been created by exporting or printing the CD-ROM data to an ASCII print file. 
  This same format is used by data bases other than Climatedata and therefore   
  these data bases can be converted using this same option.  Examples of ASCII  
  print files from Climatedata are included with the HELP program -- BIRM.PRC   
  for precipitation, BIRM.MAX for maximum temperature, BIRM.MIN for minimum     
  temperature, and PHOENIX.RAD for solar radiation.  When entering the          
  Climatedata file name, the user should include the DOS path (if the file      
  location is different than the default directory), file name and extension.   
  The user can abandon the entry of this data by pressing Esc.  Once valid      
  information is entered, the program reads the data from the specified file    
  and converts it to the HELP Version 3 format.                                 
                                                                                
  1.  Climatedata Precipitation Option (Customary Units).  The program will     
      convert daily precipitation data from an ASCII print file prepared by     
      the Climatedata CD-ROM data base program into the format used by Version  
      3 of the HELP model.  The Climatedata format is used by other CD-ROM,     
      state and regional data bases and therefore those files can also be       
      converted by this option.  For example, the State of California and the   
      Midwest Climatic Data Consortium used this same format.  The following    
      data are required for this option:                                        
                                                                                
      *  Location                                                               
                                                                                
      *  Climatedata prepared file containing daily precipitation data          
                                                                                
  2.  Climatedata Temperature Option  (Customary Units).  The program will      
      convert daily maximum and minimum temperature data from ASCII print       
      files prepared by the Climatedata CD-ROM data base program into the       
      daily mean temperature data file format used by Version 3 of the HELP     
      model.  The Climatedata format is also used by other CD-ROM, state and    
      regional data bases and therefore those files can also be converted by    
      this option.  For example, the State of California and the Midwest        
      Climatic Data Consortium used this same format.  The following data are   
      required for this option:                                                 
                                                                                
      *  Location                                                               
                                                                                
      *  Climatedata prepared file containing years of daily maximum

  3.  Climatedata Solar Radiation Option (Customary Units).  The program will   
      convert the Surface Airways ASCII print files of daily average solar      
      radiation data into a daily solar radiation data file of the format used  
      by HELP Version 3.  It is anticipated that this option may also work with 
      some other CD-ROM data sources as they become available.  The following   
      data are required for this option:

#CLIMATEDATA                                                                    
#ASCII                                                                          
                                                                                
       This option allows the user to enter daily weather data to the HELP      
  model from ASCII data files (Customary or Metric Units).  The ASCII data set  
  is composed of lines of data whose values are separated by a blank(s), a      
  comma or other non-numeric symbol.  If this option is selected, the user      
  must enter the city and state for the site, the units of the data in the      
  ASCII files.  The user can abandon the entry of this data by pressing Esc.    
  Once valid information is entered, the program then asks for the file name    
  and year of the ASCII data set, one year at a time.  Each file should         
  contain only one year of daily values for a particular type of data, either   
  precipitation, mean temperature or solar radiation.  Example ASCII data       
  files are included with the HELP program -- RAIN.1 and RAIN.2 for             
  precipitation, TEMP.1 and TEMP.2 for temperature and SOLAR.1 and SOLAR.2 for  
  solar radiation.  When entering the ASCII data file name, the user should     
  include the DOS path (if the file location is different than the default      
  directory), file name and extension.  In order to return from this option to  
  the "Precipitation, Temperature, and Solar Radiation" screen, press Esc.      
                                                                                
  1.  ASCII Precipitation Option (Customary or Metric Units).  The HELP model   
      converts daily precipitation data in an ASCII file to the HELP format.    
      Each year of ASCII precipitation data should be stored in a separate      
      file.  Extra data will be ignored.  Inadequate data will yield an error.  
      This option should also be used to convert data from spreadsheet format   
      by first printing each year of precipitation to individual print files.   
      The following data are required for this option:                          
                                                                                
      *  Location                                                               
                                                                                
      *  Files containing ASCII data                                            
                                                                                
      *  Years                                                                  
                                                                                
  2.  ASCII Temperature Option (Customary or Metric Units).  The HELP model     
      converts daily mean temperature data in an ASCII file to the HELP         
      format.  Each year of ASCII temperature data should be stored in a        
      separate file.  Extra data will be ignored.  Inadequate data will yield   
      an error.  This option should also be used to convert data from           
      spreadsheet format by first printing each year of temperature to          
      individual print files.  The following data are required for this         
      option:                                                                   
                                                                                
      *  Location                                                               
                                                                                
      *  Files containing ASCII data                                            
                                                                                
      *  Years                                                                  
                                                                                
  3.  ASCII Solar Radiation Option (Customary or Metric Units).  The HELP       
      model converts daily solar radiation data in an ASCII file to the HELP    
      format.  Each year of ASCII daily solar radiation data should be stored   
      in a separate file.  Extra data will be ignored.  Inadequate data will    
      yield an error.  This option should also be used to convert data from     
      spreadsheet format by first printing each year of solar radiation to      
      individual print files.  The following data are required for this         
      option:                                                                   
                                                                                
      *  Location                                                               
                                                                                
      *  Files containing ASCII data                                            
                                                                                
      *  Years                                                                  
#ASCII                                                                          
#HELP2                                                                          
                                                                                
       This option allows the user to enter weather data to the HELP model      
  Version 3 from a data file used in the HELP model Version 2 (Customary Units  
  Only).  If this option is selected, the user must enter the city and state    
  for the site and the HELP Version 2 data file name.  Example HELP 2 data      
  files are included with the HELP program -- ALA4 for precipitation, ALA7 for  
  temperature and ALA13 for solar radiation.  When entering the HELP 2 data     
  file name, the user should include the DOS path (if the file location is      
  different than the default directory), file name and extension.  The user     
  can abandon the entry of this data by pressing Esc.  Once valid information   
  is entered, the program reads the data from the specified file and converts   
  it to the HELP Version 3 format.                                              
                                                                                
  1.  HELP Version 2 Data Option (Customary Units).  Version 3 of the HELP      
      model converts precipitation data prepared for use in Version 2 of the    
      HELP model into the HELP Version 3 format.  This option requires the      
      following data:                                                           
                                                                                
      *  Location

  2.  HELP Version 2 Data Option  (Customary Units).  Version 3 of the HELP     
      model converts temperature data prepared for use in Version 2 of the      
      HELP model into the HELP Version 3 format.  This option requires the      
      following data:                                                           
                                                                                
      *  Location                                                               
                                                                                
      *  File containing HELP Version 2 data                                    
                                                                                
  3.  HELP Version 2 Data Option (Customary Units).  Version 3 of the HELP      
      model converts solar radiation data prepared for use in Version 2 of the  
      HELP model into the HELP Version 3 format.  This option requires the      
      following data:

#CANADIAN                                                                       
                                                                                
       This option allows the user to enter weather data to the HELP model      
  from a Canadian Climatological Data (Surface) file (Metric Units Only).  If   
  this option is selected, the user must enter the city and state for the site  
  and the Canadian Climatological Data file name.  The precipitation and mean   
  or maximum and minimum temperature data files should contain daily values     
  written in either compressed or uncompressed diskette format.  The solar      
  radiation data file should contain hourly global solar radiation values also  
  written in either compressed or uncompressed diskette format.  Example        
  Canadian data files are included with the HELP program -- CAN4.DAT and        
  CCAN4.DAT for precipitation, CAN7.DAT and CCAN7.DAT for temperature and       
  CAN13.DAT and CCAN13.DAT for solar radiation.  When entering the Canadian     
  data file name, the user should include the DOS path (if the file location    
  is different than the default directory), file name and extension.  The user  
  can abandon the entry of this data by pressing Esc.  Once valid information   
  is entered, the program reads the data from the specified file and converts   
  it to the HELP Version 3 format.                                              
                                                                                
  1.  Canadian Climatological Data Option (Metric Units).  The HELP model       
      converts Canadian Climatological Data (Surface) in compressed or          
      uncompressed diskette formats into the HELP Version 3 format.  The        
      following data are required by this option:                               
                                                                                
      *  Location                                                               
                                                                                
      *  Canadian Climatological Data file containing years of daily            
         precipitation values                                                   
                                                                                
  2.  Canadian Climatological Data Option  (Metric Units).  The HELP model      
      converts Canadian Climatological Data (Surface) in compressed or          
      uncompressed diskette formats into the HELP Version 3 format.             
      Conversion is available for daily mean or daily maximum and daily         
      minimum temperature values.  If maximum and minimum temperatures are      
      used, the program merely averages the two to compute the daily mean       
      temperature value.  If mean temperature values are used, the same file    
      is specified as the maximum and minimum temperature files.  The           
      following data are required for this option:

  3.  Canadian Climatological Data Option (Metric Units).  The HELP model       
      converts Canadian Climatological Data (Surface) in compressed or          
      uncompressed diskette formats into the HELP Version 3 format.             
      Conversion is available only for hourly global solar radiation values.    
      The following data are required by this option:

       During the creation of the weather data explained above, the data is     
  saved to a temporary file.  To save the data to permanent files, the user     
  must press F10 from the primary screens.  Once the F10 key is pressed, the    
  program verifies that all the data has been entered.  If any of the data is   
  incomplete, the program displays a list of the problem areas.  The user can   
  return to the primary screens to complete the data or continue to save the    
  incomplete data.  After displaying the deficiencies, the program displays     
  the "Weather Data - File Saving" screen.                                      
#D11VERIFY                                                                      
#SAVETAG                                                                        
                                                                                
       From the "File Saving" screen the user may save all or only some of the  
  four weather types, or completely abandon the save option.  The user should   
  tag each type of data to be saved by entering a "Y" in the "SAVE" column and  
  those not to be saved by entering a "N" in the "SAVE" column.  Default file   
  names are displayed in appropriate locations on this screen; these are the    
  same names as used in Version 2.  At this time the user may enter new file    
  names for any or all of the four types of weather data.  (See Section 4.5.1   
  for file naming convention used in HELP.)  If the file already exists, the    
  program will display "File Already Exists." after entering the name.  After   
  replacing all file names of interest, the user should press F10 or Pg Dn to   
  complete the saving to the requested file names.  If any of the files         
  already exists as the default names would, the program will ask individually  
  for each existing file whether the user wishes to have the existing file      
  overwritten.  If the user answers "Yes" for all of the files, the program     
  will overwrite the files, complete the saving process and return to the main  
  menu.  If the user answers "No" for any file, the program will interrupt the  
  saving, return to the "SAVE" column and change the tag to "N."  The user can  
  then change the tag back to "Y", rename the file, and restart the saving by   
  pressing F10 or Pg Dn.  The program provides other options listed on the      
  "File Saving" screen to provide the means for the user to return the weather  
  data entry screens (Pg Up) or to return to the main menu without saving the   
  data (F9).  The user must be cautioned that the F9 option will cause all the  
  data created (if any) to be lost.  Figure 11 shows the available options.

       One file name for each of the four types of weather data to be saved     
  is needed.  The DOS path may be specified if different from the active or     
  default drive and subdirectory, such as C:\HELP3\DATA.  The following gives   
  file naming and extension information.

     *  Any valid DOS name that the user desires (up to eight characters) is    
        acceptable.  The HELP program supplies the extension.                   
                                                                                
  This convention must be always remembered when selecting file names for       
  editing, saving, or converting data from other sources.  However, when        
  typing a file name on this screen, the user should not enter the extension    
  since the program automatically assigns the proper extension to the file      
  according to the weather types.                                               
#PATH                                                                           
                                                                                
       When selecting a file to be edited, the DOS path may be specified if     
  different from the active or default drive and subdirectory, such as          
  C:\HELP3\DATA.  The default directory is initially displayed in the           
  directory cell on the screen.  If the user specifies a drive or a directory   
  that does not exist, the program will display respectively "INVALID DRIVE"    
  or "INVALID DIRECTORY" and replaces the content with the default directory.   
                                                                                
       The current directory is displayed on the screen.  The user may obtain   
  a listing of all data files that reside on the current directory by pressing  
  F4.  By pressing F4, the program obtains a directory of all files that        
  pertain to the weather data cell from which F4 was pressed.  For example, if  
  F4 was pressed from the temperature file cell, the program will display the   
  list of files with an extension of D7 that reside on the currently specified  
  directory.  Up to 120 data files for any weather data type can be displayed   
  on the screen.  The name of the current directory where these files are       
  located is also displayed.  To obtain the data files pertaining to the        
  weather information needed that reside in another directory, the user should  
  type in the name of a valid drive and subdirectory in the Directory column    
  and then press F4 for the list of files in that subdirectory.  To display a   
  directory for another type of data, move the cursor to the row for that data  
  type and repeat the process listed above.  (See Figure 11.)                   
                                                                                
#PATH                                                                           
       To select a file from the list of displayed files, move the cursor to    
  the desired file name and press Enter.  This action transfers control back    
  to the previous screen, and the name of the file just selected will be        
  displayed in the proper cell.  The user can exit the "Data Files" screen      
  without selecting a file by pressing the Esc key.                             
                                                                                
       File names may also be typed in the proper cells.  The data file may     
  have any valid DOS name of up to 8 characters.  If the user enters an         
  illegal file name, the program displays "BAD FILE NAME" and clears the file   
  name.  The previously entered file name is erased and the user has another    
  opportunity to enter a correct file name.
