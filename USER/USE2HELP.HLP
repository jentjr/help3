The HELP user may enter weather data using several options depending     on the type of weather data being considered.  The requirements for each        weather data type are listed below.  The units used are also listed next to     each data type and/or variable.  Customary units are based on the English       System, and Metric implies SI units.                                                                                                                          3.2.1  Evapotranspiration Data                                                                                                                                         The evapotranspiration data can be entered in one of two ways:                                                                                             1.  Default Evapotranspiration Option with Location Specific Guidance               (Customary and Metric Units).  This option utilizes the data provided           by the HELP model for selected U.S. cities.  The cities are listed in           Table 1.  The data needed for this option are:                                                                                                                  *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  Evaporative zone depth (Guidance is available for the selected                  location assuming a thick layer of loamy soil with a grassy form of             vegetation.  Clayey soils would generally have larger evaporative               zone depths since it exerts greater capillary suction; analogously,             sandy soils would have smaller evaporative zone depths.  Shrubs and             trees with tap roots would have larger evaporative zone depths than             the values given in the guidance.).  The user must specify an                   evaporative zone depth and can use the guidance along with specific             design information to select a value.  The program does not permit              the evaporative depth to exceed the depth to the top of the topmost             barrier soil layer.  Similarly, the evaporative zone depth would not            be expected to extend very far into a sand drainage layer.  The                 evaporative zone depth must be greater than zero.  The evaporative              zone depth is the maximum depth from which water may be removed by              evapotranspiration.  The value specified influences the storage of              water near the surface and therefore directly affects the                       computations for evapotranspiration and runoff.  Where surface                  vegetation is present, the evaporative depth should at least equal              the expected average depth of root penetration.  The influence of               plant roots usually extends somewhat below the depth of root                    penetration because of capillary suction to the roots.  The depth               specified should be characteristic of the maximum depth to which the            moisture changes near the surface due to drying over the course of a            year, typically occurring during peak evaporative demand or when peak           quantity of vegetation is present.  Setting the evaporative depth               equal to the expected average root depth would tend to yield a low              estimate of evapotranspiration and a high estimate of drainage                  through the evaporative zone.  An evaporative depth should be                   specified for bare ground to account for direct evaporation from the            soil; this depth would be a function of the soil type and vapor and             heat flux at the surface.  The depth of capillary draw to the surface           without vegetation or to the root zone may be only several inches in            gravels; in sands the depth may be about 4 to 8 inches, in silts                about 8 to 18 inches, and in clays about 12 to 60 inches.                                                                                                    *  Maximum leaf area index (Guidance is available for the selected                 location).  The user must enter a maximum value of leaf area index              for the vegetative cover.  Leaf area index (LAI) is defined as the              dimensionless ratio of the leaf area of actively transpiring                    vegetation to the nominal surface area of the land on which the                 vegetation is growing.  The program provides the user with a maximum            LAI value typical of the location selected if the value entered by              the user cannot be supported without irrigation because of low                  rainfall or a short growing season.  This statement should be                   considered only as a warning.  The maximum LAI for bare ground is               zero.  For a poor stand of grass the LAI could approach 1.0; for a              fair stand of grass, 2.0; for a good stand of grass, 3.5; and for an            excellent stand of grass, 5.0.  The LAI for dense stands of trees and           shrubbery would also approach 5.  The program is largely insensitive            to values above 5.  If the vegetative species limit plant transpir-             ation (such as succulent plants), the maximum LAI value should be               reduced to a value equivalent of the LAI for a stand of grass that              would yield a similar quantity of plant transpiration.  Most                    landfills would tend to have at best a fair stand of grass and often            only a poor stand of grass because landfills are not designed as                ideal support systems for vegetative growth.  Surface soils are                 commonly shallow and provide little moisture storage for dry periods.           Many covers may have drains to remove infiltrated water quickly,                reducing moisture storage.  Some covers have liners near the surface            restricting root penetration and causing frequent saturation of the             surface soil which limits oxygen availability to the roots.  Some               landfills produce large quantities of gas which, if uncontrolled,               reduces the oxygen availability in the rooting zone and therefore               limits plant growth.                                                                                                                                          The program produces values for the Julian dates starting and ending       the growing season, the annual average wind speed, and the quarterly average    relative humidity for the location.  The values for the growing season          should be checked carefully to agree with the germination and harvesting        (end of seasonal growth) dates for your type of vegetation.  For example,       grasses in southern California would germinate in the fall when the rains       occurs and die off in late spring when the soil moisture is depleted.  This     contrasts with a typical growing season which would start in the spring and     end in the fall.

Manual Option (Customary and Metric Units).  The data needed for this           option are:                                                                                                                                                     *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  Evaporative zone depth.  The user must specify an evaporative zone              depth and can use the guidance given under the default option along             with specific design information to select a value.  The program does           not permit the evaporative depth to exceed the depth to the top of              the topmost barrier soil layer.  Similarly, the evaporative zone                depth would not be expected to extend very far into a sand drainage             layer.  The evaporative zone depth must be greater than zero.  The              evaporative zone depth is the maximum depth from which water may be             removed by evapotranspiration.  The value specified influences the              storage of water near the surface and therefore directly affects the            computations for evapotranspiration and runoff.  Where surface                  vegetation is present, the evaporative depth should at least equal              the expected average depth of root penetration.  The influence of               plant roots usually extends somewhat below the depth of root                    penetration because of capillary suction to the roots.  The depth               specified should be characteristic of the maximum depth to which the            moisture changes near the surface due to drying over the course of a            year, typically occurring during peak evaporative demand or when peak           quantity of vegetation is present.  Setting the evaporative depth               equal to the expected average root depth would tend to yield a low              estimate of evapotranspiration and a high estimate of drainage                  through the evaporative zone.  An evaporative depth should be                   specified for bare ground to account for direct evaporation from the            soil; this depth would be a function of the soil type and vapor and             heat flux at the surface.  The depth of capillary draw to the surface           without vegetation or to the root zone may be only several inches in            gravels; in sands the depth may be about 4 to 8 inches, in silts                about 8 to 18 inches, and in clays about 12 to 60 inches.  Rooting              depth is dependent on manner factors -- species, moisture                       availability, maturation, soil type and plant density.  In humid                areas where moisture is readily available near the surface, grasses             may have rooting depth of 6 to 24 inches.  In drier areas, the                  rooting depth is very sensitive to plant species and to the depth to            which moisture is stored and may range from 6 to 48 inches.  The                evaporative zone depth would be somewhat greater than the rooting               depth.  Local agricultural extension services can provide information           on characteristic rooting depths for vegetation in specific areas.                                                                                           *  Maximum leaf area index.  The user must enter a maximum value of leaf           area index for the vegetative cover.  Leaf area index (LAI) is                  defined as the dimensionless ratio of the leaf area of actively                 transpiring vegetation to the nominal surface area of the land on               which the vegetation is growing.  The program provides the user with            a maximum LAI value typical of the location selected if the value               entered by the user cannot be supported without irrigation because of           low rainfall or a short growing season.  This statement should be               considered only as a warning.  The maximum LAI for bare ground is               zero.  For a poor stand of grass the LAI could approach 1.0; for a              fair stand of grass, 2.0; for a good stand of grass, 3.5; and for an            excellent stand of grass, 5.0.  The LAI for dense stands of trees and           shrubbery would also approach 5.  The program is largely insensitive            to values above 5.  If the vegetative species limit plant transpir-             ation (such as succulent plants), the maximum LAI value should                  be reduced to a value equivalent of the LAI for a stand of grass that           would yield a similar quantity of plant transpiration.  Most                    landfills would tend to have at best a fair stand of grass and often            only a poor stand of grass because landfills are not designed as                ideal support systems for vegetative growth.  Surface soils are                 commonly shallow and provide little moisture storage for dry periods.           Many covers may have drains to remove infiltrated water quickly,                reducing moisture storage.  Some covers have liners near the surface            restricting root penetration and causing frequent saturation of the             surface soil which limits oxygen availability to the roots.  Some               landfills produce large quantities of gas which, if uncontrolled,               reduces the oxygen availability in the rooting zone and therefore               limits plant growth.                                                                                                                                         *  Dates starting and ending the growing season.  The start of the                 growing season is based on mean daily temperature and plant species.            Typically, the start of the growing season for grasses is the Julian            date (day of the year) when the normal mean daily temperature rises             above 50 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit.  The growing season ends when the            normal mean daily temperatures falls below 50 to 55 degrees                     Fahrenheit.  In cooler climates the start and end would be at lower             temperatures and in warmer climates at higher temperatures.  Data on            normal mean daily temperature is available from "Climate of the                 States" reference books and the "Climatic Atlas of the United States"           published by National Climate Center of NOAA.  In locations where the           growing season extends year-round, the start of the growing season              should be reported as day 0 and the end as day 367.  The values for             the growing season should be checked carefully to agree with the                germination and harvesting (end of seasonal growth) dates for your              type of vegetation.  For example, grasses in southern California                would germinate in the fall when the rains occur and die off in late            spring when the soil moisture is depleted.  This contrasts with a               typical growing season which would start in the spring and end in the           fall.                                                                                                                                                        *  Normal average annual wind speed.  This data is available from NOAA             annual climatological data summary, "Climate of the States" reference           books and the "Climatic Atlas of the United States."                                                                                                         *  Normal average quarterly relative humidity.  This data is available             from NOAA annual climatological data summary, "Climate of the States"           reference books and the "Climatic Atlas of the United States."                                                                                         3.2.2  Precipitation Data                                                                                                                                         1.  Default Precipitation Option (Customary Units).  The user may select            five years of historic precipitation data for any of the 102 U.S. cities        listed in Table 2.  The input needed for this option is:                                                                                                        *  Location                                                                                                                                                        NOTE:  The user should be aware of the limitations of using the                 default historical precipitation data.  None of the 102 locations for           which data is available may be representative of the study site since           rainfall is spatially very variable.  In addition, the five years for           which default data are available (1974-1978 in most cases) may not              have been typical, but were unusually wet or dry.  It is therefore              highly recommended that the user examine the rainfall and determine             how representative it is of normal, wet and dry years at the study              site.  It is also recommended that the simulation be run for more               than five years to determine long-term performance of the landfill              using, if  necessary, one of the other precipitation input options to           examine the design under the range of possible weather conditions.

Synthetic Precipitation Option (Customary or Metric Units).  The program        will generate from 1 to 100 years of daily precipitation data                   stochastically for the selected location using a synthetic weather              generator.  The synthetic precipitation data will have approximately the        same statistical characteristics as the historic data at the selected           location.  If desired, the user can enter normal mean monthly                   precipitation values for the specific location to improve the                   statistical characteristics of the resulting daily values.  The user is         advised to enter normal mean monthly precipitation values if the project        site is located some distance from the city selected from Table 3.  The         daily values will vary from month to month and from year to year and            will not equal the normal values entered.  The same data is produced            every time the option is used for a given location.  The data required          by the synthetic weather generator are:                                                                                                                         *  Location (select from a list of 139 U.S. cities in Table 3)                                                                                                  *  Number of years of data to be generated                                                                                                                      *  Normal mean monthly precipitation (Optional, default values are                 available.)

Create/Edit Precipitation Option (Customary or Metric Units).  Under            the Create option, the user may enter from 1 to 100 years of daily              precipitation data manually.  The years, which need not be consecutive,         can be entered in any order.  The user may add or delete years of data          or rearrange the order of the years of data.  This same option can be           used to edit the daily values of any year of data; commonly, this is            used to add severe storm events, such as the 25-yr, 24-hr precipitation         event.  The data required are:                                                                                                                                  *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  One or more years of daily precipitation data                                                                                                            4.  NOAA Tape Precipitation Option (Customary Units).  The option will              convert the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)              Summary of Day daily precipitation data written to diskette in ASCII            print as-on-tape format into the format used by Version 3 of the HELP           model.  The following data are required for this option:                                                                                                        *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  NOAA ASCII print file of Summary of Day daily precipitation data in             as-on-tape format                                                                                                                                            NOTE:  Daily precipitation data and normal mean monthly precipitation           values for most locations are readily available in publications or on           diskette from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.              Information on climatological data sources can be obtained from the             National Climatic Data Center, NOAA, Federal Building, Asheville, NC            28801, (704) 259-0682.                                                                                                                                      5.  Climatedata Precipitation Option (Customary Units).  The program will           convert daily precipitation data from an ASCII print file prepared by           the Climatedata CD-ROM data base program into the format used by Version        3 of the HELP model.  The Climatedata format is used by other CD-ROM,           state and regional data bases and therefore those files can also be             converted by this option.  For example, the State of California and the         Midwest Climatic Data Consortium used this same format.  The following          data are required for this option:                                                                                                                              *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  Climatedata prepared file containing daily precipitation data                                                                                            6.  ASCII Precipitation Option (Customary or Metric Units).  The HELP model         converts daily precipitation data in an ASCII file to the HELP format.          Each year of ASCII precipitation data should be stored in a separate            file.  Extra data will be ignored.  Inadequate data will yield an error.        This option should also be used to convert data from spreadsheet format         by first printing each year of precipitation to individual print files.         The following data are required for this option:                                                                                                                *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  Files containing ASCII data                                                                                                                                  *  Years                                                                                                                                                    7.  HELP Version 2 Data Option (Customary Units).  Version 3 of the HELP            model converts precipitation data prepared for use in Version 2 of the          HELP model into the HELP Version 3 format.  This option requires the            following data:                                                                                                                                                 *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  File containing HELP Version 2 data                                                                                                                      8.  Canadian Climatological Data Option (Metric Units).  The HELP model             converts Canadian Climatological Data (Surface) in compressed or                uncompressed diskette formats into the HELP Version 3 format.  The              following data are required by this option:                                                                                                                     *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  Canadian Climatological Data file containing years of daily                     precipitation values                                                                                                                                         NOTE:  Canadian Climatological Data for most locations are readily              available in publications of the Environment Canada, Atmospheric                Environment Service, Canadian Climate Centre, Data Management Division,         4905 Dufferin Street, Downsview, Ontario, Canada  M3H 5T4.                                                                                                3.2.3  Temperature Data                                                                                                                                           1.  Synthetic Temperature Option (Customary or Metric Units).  The program          will generate from 1 to 100 years of temperature data stochastically for        the selected location.  The synthetic generation of daily temperature           values is a weak function of precipitation and as such the user must            first specify the precipitation.  Generation of temperature data is             limited to the number of years of precipitation data available.  The            synthetic temperature data will have approximately the same statistical         characteristics as the historic data at the selected location.  If              desired, the user can enter normal mean monthly temperature values for          the specific location to improve the statistical characteristics of the         resulting daily values.  The user is advised to enter normal mean               monthly temperature values if the project site is located some distance         from the city selected from Table 1.  The data required by the synthetic        weather generator are:                                                                                                                                          *  Location (select from a list of 183 U.S. cities in Table 1)                                                                                                  *  Number of years of data to be generated                                                                                                                      *  Years of daily precipitation values                                                                                                                          *  Normal mean monthly temperature (Optional, default values are                   available.)                                                                                                                                              2.  Create/Edit Temperature Option (Customary or Metric Units).  Under the          create option, the user may enter up to 100 years of daily temperature          data manually.  The years, which need not be consecutive, can be entered        in any order.  The user may add or delete years of data or rearrange the        order of the years of data.  This same option can be used to edit the           daily values of any year of data.  The data required are:                                                                                                       *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  One or more years of daily temperature data                                                                                                              3.  NOAA Tape Temperature Option (Customary Units).  This option will               convert the NOAA Summary of Day daily temperature data written to               diskette in ASCII print as-on-tape format into the format used by               Version 3 of the HELP model.  The program will accept either mean daily         temperature or daily maximum and minimum temperature values.  If maximum        and minimum temperatures are used, the program merely averages the two          to compute the daily mean temperature value.  If mean temperature values        are used, the same file is specified as the maximum and minimum                 temperature files.  The following data are required for this option:                                                                                            *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  NOAA ASCII print file of Summary of Day data file containing                    years of daily maximum temperature values or daily mean                         temperature values in as-on-tape format                                                                                                                      *  NOAA ASCII print file of Summary of Day data file containing                    years of daily minimum temperature values or daily mean                         temperature values in as-on-tape format                                                                                                                         NOTE:  Daily temperature (mean or maximum and minimum) data and                 normal mean monthly temperature values for most locations are readily           available in publications or on diskette from the National Oceanic              and Atmospheric Administration.  Information on climatological data             sources can be obtained from the National Climatic Data Center, NOAA,           Federal Building, Asheville, NC 28801, (704) 259-0682.                                                                                                   4.  Climatedata Temperature Option  (Customary Units).  The program will            convert daily maximum and minimum temperature data from ASCII print             files prepared by the Climatedata CD-ROM data base program into the             daily mean temperature data file format used by Version 3 of the HELP           model.  The Climatedata format is also used by other CD-ROM, state and          regional data bases and therefore those files can also be converted by          this option.  For example, the State of California and the Midwest              Climatic Data Consortium used this same format.  The following data are         required for this option:                                                                                                                                       *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  Climatedata prepared file containing years of daily maximum                     temperature data                                                                                                                                             *  Climatedata prepared file containing years of daily minimum                     temperature data                                                                                                                                         5.  ASCII Temperature Option (Customary or Metric Units).  The HELP model           converts daily mean temperature data in an ASCII file to the HELP               format.  Each year of ASCII temperature data should be stored in a              separate file.  Extra data will be ignored.  Inadequate data will yield         an error.  This option should also be used to convert data from                 spreadsheet format by first printing each year of temperature to                individual print files.  The following data are required for this               option:                                                                                                                                                         *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  Files containing ASCII data                                                                                                                                  *  Years                                                                                                                                                    6.  HELP Version 2 Data Option  (Customary Units).  Version 3 of the HELP           model converts temperature data prepared for use in Version 2 of the            HELP model into the HELP Version 3 format.  This option requires the            following data:                                                                                                                                                 *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  File containing HELP Version 2 data                                                                                                                      7.  Canadian Climatological Data Option  (Metric Units).  The HELP model            converts Canadian Climatological Data (Surface) in compressed or                uncompressed diskette formats into the HELP Version 3 format.                   Conversion is available only for daily mean temperature values.  The            following data are required by this option:                                                                                                                     *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  Canadian Climatological Data file containing years of daily mean                temperature values                                                                                                                                              NOTE:  Canadian Climatological Data for most locations are readily              available in publications of the Environment Canada, Atmospheric                Environment Service, Canadian Climate Centre, Data Management                   Division, 4905 Dufferin Street, Downsview, Ontario, Canada  M3H 5T4.                                                                                   3.2.4  Solar Radiation Data                                                                                                                                       1.  Synthetic Solar Radiation Option (Customary or Metric Units).  The              program will generate from 1 to 100 years of daily solar radiation data         stochastically for the selected location.  The synthetic generation of          daily solar radiation values is a strong function of precipitation and          as such the user must first specify the precipitation.  Generation of           solar radiation data is limited to the number of years of precipitation         data available.  The synthetic solar radiation data will have                   approximately the same statistical characteristics as the historic data         at the selected location.  If desired, the user can enter the latitude          for the specific location to improve the computation of potential solar         radiation and the resulting daily values.  The user is advised to enter         the latitude if the project site is more than 50 miles north or south of        the city selected from Table 1.  The data required by the synthetic             weather generator are:                                                                                                                                          *  Location (select from a list of 183 U.S. cities in Table 1)                                                                                                  *  Number of years of data to be generated                                                                                                                      *  Years of daily precipitation values                                                                                                                          *  Latitude (Optional, default value is available.)                                                                                                         2.  Create/Edit Solar Radiation Option (Customary or Metric Units).  Under          the create option, the user may enter up to 100 years of daily solar            radiation data manually.  The years, which need not be consecutive, can         be entered in any order.  The user may add or delete years of data or           rearrange the order of the years of data.  This same option can be used         to edit the daily values of any year of data.  The data required are:                                                                                           *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  One or more years of daily solar radiation data                                                                                                          3.  NOAA Tape Solar Radiation Option (Customary Units).  This option will           convert the NOAA Surface Airways Hourly solar radiation data written to         diskette in ASCII print as-on-tape format into the format used by               Version 3 of the HELP model.  The following data are required for this          option:                                                                                                                                                         *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  NOAA ASCII print file of Surface Airways Hourly solar radiation data            in as-on-tape format                                                                                                                                            NOTE:  Hourly solar radiation data is available for only a limited              number of sites and for only a limited duration.  It is generally               available in publications or on diskette from the National Oceanic              and Atmospheric Administration.  Information on climatological data             sources can be obtained from the National Climatic Data Center, NOAA,           Federal Building, Asheville, NC 28801, (704) 259-0682.                                                                                                   4.  Climatedata Solar Radiation Option (Customary Units).  The program will         convert the Surface Airways daily average solar radiation data exported         to ASCII print files by CD-ROM software into a daily solar radiation            data file of the format used by HELP Version 3.  It is anticipated that         this option may also work with some other data sources as they become           available.  The following data are required for this option:                                                                                                    *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  Surface Airways prepared file containing years of daily average solar           radiation data                                                                                                                                           5.  ASCII Solar Radiation Option (Customary or Metric Units).  The HELP             model converts daily solar radiation data in an ASCII file to the HELP          format.  Each year of ASCII daily solar radiation data should be stored         in a separate file.  Extra data will be ignored.  Inadequate data will          yield an error.  This option should also be used to convert data from           spreadsheet format by first printing each year of solar radiation to            individual print files.  The following data are required for this               option:                                                                                                                                                         *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  Files containing ASCII data                                                                                                                                  *  Years                                                                                                                                                    6.  HELP Version 2 Data Option (Customary Units).  Version 3 of the HELP            model converts solar radiation data prepared for use in Version 2 of the        HELP model into the HELP Version 3 format.

Canadian Climatological Data Option (Metric Units).  The HELP model             converts Canadian Climatological Data (Surface) in compressed or                uncompressed diskette formats into the HELP Version 3 format.                   Conversion is available only for hourly global solar radiation values.          The following data are required by this option:                                                                                                                 *  Location                                                                                                                                                     *  Canadian Climatological Data file containing years of hourly global             solar radiation values                                                                                                                                       NOTE:  Canadian Climatological Data for most locations are readily              available in publications of the Environment Canada, Atmospheric                Environment Service, Canadian Climate Centre, Data Management Division,         4905 Dufferin Street, Downsview, Ontario, Canada  M3H 5T4.                                                                                                3.9.2  Limits of Application                                                                                                                                           The model can handle water routing through or storage in up to twenty      soil or waste layers; as many as five liner systems may be employed.  The       simulation period can range from 1 to 100 years.  The model cannot simulate     a capillary break or unsaturated lateral drainage.                                                                                                                   Values for the leaf area index may range from 0 for bare ground to 5       for an excellent stand of grass.  Detailed recommendations for leaf area        indices and evaporative depths are given in the program.                                                                                                             The default values for the evaporation coefficient are based on            experimental results.  The basis for the calculation of these default values    is described by Schroeder et al. (1994).  The model imposes upper and lower     limits of 5.1 and 3.3 so as not to exceed the range of experimental data.

Synthetic daily       temperature is a function of normal mean monthly temperature and the            occurrence of rainfall.  Synthetic daily solar radiation is a function of       latitude, occurrence of rainfall, average daily dry-day solar radiation and     average daily wet-day solar radiation.                                                                                                                        #U3HELP                                                                         #U4HELP                                                                                                                                                         3.3  SOIL AND DESIGN DATA REQUIREMENTS                                                                                                                                 The user may enter soil data by using the default soil/material            textures option, the user-defined soil texture option, or a manual option.      If the user selects a default soil texture, the program will display            porosity, field capacity, wilting point, and hydraulic conductivity values      of the soil that is stored as default.  There are 42 default soil/material      textures.  If user-defined soil textures are selected, the program will         display the porosity, field capacity, wilting point, and hydraulic              conductivity of the selected soil from the user- defined soil texture data      file.  In the manual soil texture option, the user must specify values for      the soil parameters.  General data requirements for all options are listed      below.

Figure 1 shows a typical landfill profile with eleven layers.  The program      recognizes four general types of layers.                                                                                                                             1.

Barrier soil liners                                                         4.  Geomembrane liners                                                                                                                                     It must be noted that correct classification of layers is very important        because the program models the flow of water through the four types of          layers in different ways.                                                                                                                                            Flow in a vertical percolation layer (e.g., Layers 1 and 5 in Figure 1)    is by unsaturated vertical drainage downward due to gravity drainage; upward    flux due to evapotranspiration is modeled as an extraction.  The rate of        gravity drainage (percolation) in a vertical percolation layer is a function    of soil moisture and soil texture data.  The saturated hydraulic                conductivity specified for a vertical percolation layer should be in the        vertical direction for anisotropic materials.  The main role of a vertical      percolation layer is to provide moisture storage.  Waste layers and layers      designed to support vegetation and provide evaporative storage are normally     designated as vertical percolation layers.                                                                                                                           Lateral drainage layers (e.g., Layers 2, 6, 7 and 9 in Figure 1) are       layers directly above liners that are designed to promote drainage laterally    to a collection and removal system.  Vertical flow in a lateral drainage        layer is modeled in the same manner as a vertical percolation layer, but        saturated lateral drainage is allowed.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity    specified for a lateral drainage layer should be in the lateral direction       (downslope) for anisotropic materials.  A lateral drainage layer may be         underlain by only another lateral drainage layer or a liner.  The drainage      slope specified for a lateral drainage should be the slope of the surface of    the liner underlying the drainage layer in the direction of flow (the           maximum gradient for a section of liner in a single plane) and may range        from 0 to 50 percent.  The drainage length specified for a lateral drainage     layer is the length of the horizontal projection of a representative flow       path from the crest to the collector rather than the distance along the         slope.  For slopes of less than ten percent, the difference is negligible.      The drainage length must be greater than zero but does not have a practical     upper limit.  Recirculation is permitted from lateral drainage layers           directly above a liner where 0 to 100 percent of the drainage collected can     be recirculated and redistributed in a user-specified vertical percolation      or lateral drainage layer.                                                                                                                                           Barrier soil liners (e.g., Layers 4, and 11 in Figure 1) are intended      to restrict vertical drainage (percolation/leakage).  These layers should       have saturated hydraulic conductivities substantially lower than those of       the other types of layers.  Liners are assumed to be saturated at all times     but leak only when there is a positive head on the top surface of the liner.    The percolation rate depends upon the depth of water-saturated soil (head)      above the base of the liner, the thickness of the liner and the saturated       hydraulic conductivity.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity specified for     a barrier soil liner should be its value for passing the expected permeant      in the vertical direction for anisotropic materials.  The program allows        only downward saturated flow in barrier soil liners.  Evapotranspiration and    lateral drainage are not permitted from a liner.  Thus, any water moving        into a liner will eventually percolate through.  In Version 3 composite         liners are modeled as two layers -- a geomembrane liner and a barrier soil      liner as shown in Figure 1.                                                                                                                                          Geomembrane liners (e.g., Layers 3, 8 and 10 in Figure 1) are virtually    impermeable synthetic membranes that reduces the area of vertical               drainage/percolation/leakage to a very small fraction of the area located       near manufacturing flaws and installation defects (punctures, tears and         faulty seaming).  Some small quantity of vapor transport across the membrane    occurs and is modeled by specifying the vapor diffusivity as the saturated      hydraulic conductivity of the geomembrane.  Geomembranes leak only when         there is a positive head on the top surface of the liner.  The leakage rate     depends on the depth of saturated soil (head) above the liner, the saturated    hydraulic conductivity of the drainage limiting soil layer adjacent to the      membrane, the contact between the membrane and the adjacent drainage            limiting soil layer, geomembrane properties and the size and number of holes    in the geomembrane liner.  Aging of geomembranes is not considered.                                                                                                  While the HELP program is quite flexible, there are some basic rules       that must be followed regarding the arrangement of layers in the profile.                                                                                         1.  A vertical percolation layer may not be underlying a lateral drainage              layer.                                                                   2.  A barrier soil liner may not be underlying another barrier soil liner.      3.  A geomembrane liner may not be placed directly between two barrier                 soil liners.                                                             4.  A geomembrane liner may not be underlying another geomembrane liner.        5.  A barrier soil liner may not be placed directly between two                        geomembrane liners.                                                      6.  When a barrier soil or geomembrane liner is not placed directly below              the lowest drainage layer, all drainage layers below the lowest                 liner are treated as vertical percolation layers.  Thus, no lateral             drainage is computed for the bottom section of the landfill.             7.  The top layer may not be a barrier soil liner.                              8.  The top layer may not be a geomembrane liner.                               9.  The profile can contain no more than a total of five barrier soil                  liners and geomembrane liners.                                                                                                                              The HELP model does not permit two barrier soil liners to be adjacent      to each other.  If your design has two soil layers adjacent to each other       that would be expected to act as a single liner and both soils will remain      nearly saturated and contribute significantly to the head loss and              restriction of vertical drainage, then the thickness of the two layers          should be summed and an effective saturated hydraulic conductivity should be    computed for the combined liner.  The effective saturated hydraulic             conductivity should be computed as follows:                                                                                                                                            Te                     sum of Ti for i = 1 to n             Ke  =  -----------------------------  =  -----------------------------                  sum of Ti/Ki for i = 1 to n       sum of Ti/Ki for i = 1 to n                                                                                        where                                                                                 Ke  =  effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of combined liner             Te  =  effective thickness of combined liner                                    Ki  =  saturated hydraulic conductivity of liner soil i                         Ti  =  thickness of liner soil i                                                n   =  number of liner soils in the combined liner                                                                                                             For computational purposes, the soil profile is partitioned into           subprofiles.  Subprofiles are defined in relation to the location of the        liners.  The first (top) subprofile shown on Figure 1 extends from the          landfill surface to the bottom of the highest liner system (bottom of the       composite liner, Layer 4) upper barrier soil layer.  The second subprofile      extends from the top of the layer (Layer 5) below the bottom of the first       liner system to the base of the second liner system (Layer 8).  The third       (bottom) subprofile extends from the top of the layer below the second liner    system (the leakage detection drainage layer, Layer 9) to the base of the       lowest liner (Layer 11).  The program allows up to five liner systems and       therefore five subprofiles plus an additional subprofile of vertical            percolation layers below the bottom liner system.  The program models the       flow of water through one subprofile at a time from top to bottom, with the     percolation or leakage from one subprofile serving as the inflow to the         underlying subprofile.                                                                                                                                        3.5  SOIL CHARACTERISTICS                                                                                                                                              The user can assign soil characteristics to a layer using the default      option, the user defined soil option, or the manual option.  Table 4 shows      the default characteristics for 42 soil/material textures.  The soil            textures are classified according to two standard systems -- the U.S.           Department of Agriculture classification system and the Unified Soil            Classification System.  The default characteristics of textures 1 through 15    are typical of surficial and disturbed agricultural soils, which may be less    consolidated and more aerated than soils typically placed in landfills          (Rawls et al., 1982; Breazeale and McGeorge, 1949; England, 1970; Lutton et     al., 1979).  Clays and silts in landfills would generally be compacted          except within the vegetative layer, which might be tilled to promote            vegetative growth.  Untilled vegetative layers may be more compacted than       the loams listed in Table 4.  Soil textures 22 through 29 are compacted         soils.  Soil texture type 18 is representative of typical municipal solid       waste that has been compacted.  Soil texture types 16 and 17 denote very        well compacted clay soils that might be used for barrier soil liners.  The      user assigns default soil characteristics to a layer simply by specifying       the appropriate soil texture number.  The user-defined soil option accepts      non-default soil characteristics for layers assigned soil textures greater      than 42.  This is especially convenient for specifying characteristics of       waste layers.  User-specified soil characteristics can be assigned any soil     textures greater than 42.

The         saturated hydraulic conductivity value is multiplied by an empirical factor     that is computed as a function of the user-specified maximum leaf area          index.  Example values of this factor are 1.0 for a maximum LAI of 0 (bare      ground), 1.8 for a maximum LAI of 1 (poor stand of grass), 3.0 for a maximum    LAI of 2 (fair stand of grass), 4.2 for a maximum LAI of 3.3 (good stand of     grass) and 5.0 for a maximum LAI of 5 (excellent stand of grass).                                                                                                    The manual option requires values for porosity, field capacity, wilting    point, and saturated hydraulic conductivity.  These and related soil            properties are defined below.                                                                                                                                        Soil Moisture Storage (Content):  the ratio of the volume of water in               a soil to the total volume occupied by the soil, water and voids.

Field Capacity:  the soil moisture storage/content after a prolonged                period of gravity drainage from saturation corresponding to the                 soil water storage when a soil exerts a soil suction of 1/3 bar.                                                                                            Wilting Point:  the lowest soil moisture storage/content that can be                achieved by plant transpiration or air-drying, that is the moisture             content where a plant will be permanently wilted corresponding to               the soil water storage when a soil exerts a soil suction of 15                  bars.                                                                                                                                                       Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  the rate at which water drains                   through a saturated soil under a unit pressure gradient.                                                                                               Porosity, field capacity and wilting point are all dimensionless numbers        between 0 and 1.  Porosity must be greater than field capacity, which           in turn must be greater than the wilting point.  The wilting point must be      greater than zero.  The values for porosity, field capacity and wilting         point are not used for liners, except for initializing the soil water           storage of liners to the porosity value.                                                                                                                             The soil moisture retention properties of a layer should be adjusted       downward if some volume of the layer does not participate in the drainage       and storage of infiltrated water.  This condition commonly exists in layers     of municipal solid waste because municipal solid waste is very                  heterogeneous.  The plastics in the waste also channels the drainage, limits    the spreading of infiltration, and restricts the wetting of the waste and,      therefore, the storage.  Default soil texture number 19 provides adjusted       retention values for a municipal solid waste with significant channeling; it    assumes that only 25 percent of the volume is actively involved in drainage     and storage of infiltration.  As the values were computed by multiplying the    values for municipal solid waste (default texture number 18) by 0.25; the       initial soil water content would also be multiplied by 0.25.                                                                                                         The HELP user has the option of specifying the initial volumetric water    storage (content) of all layers except liners.  Liners are assumed to remain    saturated at all times.  If the user chooses not to specify initial water       contents, the program estimates values near steady-state and then runs one      year of initialization to refine the estimates before starting the              simulation.  The soil water contents at the end of this year of                 initialization are taken as the initial values for the simulation period.       The program then runs the complete simulation, starting again from the          beginning of the first year of data.  The results for the initialization        period are not reported.  To improve initialization to steady-state moisture    storage, the user should replace thick vertical percolation and lateral         drainage layers, that are below the evaporative zone and above the saturated    zone above liners, with thin layers.  Then, run the simulation for a number     of years until steady-state is approximated.  The final dimensionless water     storage values after nearing steady-state should then be specified as the       initial water contents in your actual simulation using the true dimensions      of the layers.                                                                                                                                                       The initial moisture content of municipal solid waste is a function of     the composition of the waste; reported values for fresh wastes range from       about 0.08 to 0.20 vol/vol.  The average value is about 0.12 vol/vol for        compacted municipal solid waste.  If using default waste texture 19, where      75% of the volume is inactive, the initial moisture content should be that      of only the active portion, 25% of the values reported above.                                                                                                        The soil water storage or content used in the HELP model is on a per       volume basis (THETA), volume of water (Vw) per total (bulk--soil, water and     air) soil volume (Vt = Vs + Vw + Va), which is characteristic of practice in    agronomy and soil physics.  Engineers more commonly express moisture content    on a per mass basis (w), mass of water (Mw) per mass of soil (Ms).  The two     can be related to each other by knowing the dry bulk density (RHOdb), dry       bulk specific gravity (GAMMAdb) of the soil (ratio of dry bulk density to       water density (RHOw), wet bulk density (RHOwb), wet bulk specific gravity       (GAMMAwb) of the soil (ratio of wet bulk density to water density).                                                                                                                               RHOdb                                                              THETA  =  w -------  =  w (GAMMAdb)                                                          RHOw                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       w      RHOwb         w                                             THETA  =  -------  -------  =  -------  (GAMMAwb)                                          1 + w    RHOw        1 + w                                                                                                                                                                                         3.6  GEOMEMBRANE CHARACTERISTICS                                                                                                                                       The user can assign geomembrane liner characteristics (vapor               diffusivity/saturated hydraulic conductivity) to a layer using the default      option, the user-defined soil option, or the manual option.  Saturated          hydraulic conductivity for geomembranes is defined in terms of its              equivalence to the vapor diffusivity.  The porosity, field capacity and         wilting point are not needed for geomembranes.  Table 4 shows the default       characteristics for 12 geomembrane liners.  The user assigns default soil       characteristics to a layer simply by specifying the appropriate geomembrane     liner texture number.  The user-defined option accepts user specified           geomembrane liner characteristics for layers assigned textures greater than     42.  Manual geomembrane liner characteristics can be assigned any texture       greater than 42.                                                                                                                                                     Regardless of the method of specifying the geomembrane "soil"              characteristics, the program also requires values for geomembrane liner         thickness, pinhole density, installation defect density, geomembrane            placement quality and the transmissivity of geotextiles separating              geomembranes and drainage limiting soils.  Some of these parameters are         defined below.                                                                                                                                                       Pinhole Density:  the number of defects (diameter of hole equal to                  or smaller than the geomembrane thickness; hole estimated as 1 mm               in diameter) in a given area generally resulting from manufacturing             flaws such as polymerization deficiencies.                                                                                                                  Installation Defect Density:  the number of defects (diameter of hole               larger than the geomembrane thickness; hole estimated as 1 cm^2 in              area) per acre resulting primarily from seaming faults and                      punctures during installation.                                                                                                                              Geotextile Transmissivity:  the product of the in-plane saturated                   hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the geotextile.                                                                                                     The density of pinholes and installation defects is a subject of           speculation.  Ideally, geomembranes would not have any defects.  If any were    known to exist during construction, the defects would be repaired.  However,    geomembranes are known to leak and therefore reasonably conservative            estimates of the defect densities should be specified to determine the          maximum probable leakage quantities.                                                                                                                                 The density of defects have been measured at a number of landfills and     other facilities and reported in the literature.  These findings provide        guidance for estimating the defect densities.  Typical geomembranes may have    about 0.5 to 1 pinholes per acre (1 to 2 pinholes per hectare) from             manufacturing defects.  The density of installation defects is a function of    the quality of installation, testing, materials, surface preparation,           equipment, and QA/QC program.  Representative installation defect densities     as a function of the quality of installation are given below for landfills      being built today with the state-of-the-art in materials, equipment and         QA/QC.  The estimates are based on limited data but are characteristic of       the recommendations provided in the literature.

The user is expected to enter placement quality of the geomembrane         liner if pinholes or installation defects are reported.  There are six          different possible entries for the geomembrane liner placement quality.  The    program selects which equation will be used to compute the geomembrane based    on the placement quality specified and the saturated hydraulic conductivity     of the lower permeability soil (drainage limiting soil) adjacent to the         geomembrane.  The program has different equations for three ranges of           saturated hydraulic conductivity:  greater than or equal to 0.1 cm/sec; less    than 0.1 and greater than or equal to 0.0001 cm/sec; and less than 0.0001       cm/sec.                                                                                                                                                              1.  Perfect:  Assumes perfect contact between geomembrane and adjacent                 soil that limits drainage rate (no gap, "sprayed-on" seal                       between membrane and soil formed in place).                                                                                                              2.  Excellent:  Assumes exceptional contact between geomembrane and                    adjacent soil that limits drainage rate (typically achievable                   only in the lab or small field lysimeters).                                                                                                              3.  Good:  Assumes good field installation with well-prepared, smooth                  soil surface and geomembrane wrinkle control to insure good                     contact between geomembrane and adjacent soil that limits                       drainage rate.                                                                                                                                           4.  Poor:  Assumes poor field installation with a less well-prepared                   soil surface and/or geomembrane wrinkling providing poor contact                between geomembrane and adjacent soil that limits drainage rate,                resulting in a larger gap for spreading and greater leakage.                                                                                             5.  Worst Case:  Assumes no contact between geomembrane and adjacent                   soil that limits drainage rate, resulting in leakage rate                       controlled only by the size of the hole in the geomembrane.                                                                                              6.  Geotextile separating geomembrane liner and drainage limiting soil:                Assumes leakage spreading and rate is controlled by the in-plane                transmissivity of the geotextile separating the geomembrane and                 the adjacent soil layer that would have otherwise limited the                   drainage.  This quality would not normally be used with a                       geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) as the controlling soil layer.                    Upon wetting, the bentonite swells and extrudes into the                        geotextile, filling its voids and reducing its transmissivity                   below the point where it can contribute significantly to                        spreading of leakage.  GCL's, when properly placed, tend to have                intimate contact with the geomembrane.                                                                                                            3.7  SITE CHARACTERISTICS                                                                                                                                              The user must also supply a value of the SCS runoff curve number for       Antecedent Moisture Condition II (AMC-II) or provide information so that a      curve number can be computed.  Unlike Version 2 of the HELP model, Version 3    accounts for surface slope effects on curve number and runoff.  In Version 3    of the HELP model, there are three different options by which a curve number    can be obtained.                                                                                                                                                     1.

A curve number defined by the user and modified according to the                landfill's surface slope and slope length                                   3.  A curve number is computed by the HELP model based on landfill                  surface slope, slope length, soil texture of the top layer, and the             vegetative cover.  Some general guidance for selection of runoff                curve numbers is provided in Figure 2 (USDA, Soil Conservation                  Service, 1972).  (see User's Guide for figure)                                                                                                              Two of the options account for surface slope.  The correlation between     surface slope conditions and curve number were developed for slopes ranging     from 1% to as high as 50% and for slope lengths ranging from 50 to 2000 ft.                                                                                   3.9.2  Limits of Application                                                                                                                                           The model can handle water routing through or storage in up to twenty      soil or waste layers; as many as five liner systems may be employed.  The       simulation period can range from 1 to 100 years.  The model cannot simulate     a capillary break or unsaturated lateral drainage.                                                                                                                   The model has limits on the arrangement of layers in the landfill          profile.  Each layer must be described as being one of four types:  vertical    percolation layer, lateral drainage layer, barrier soil liner or geomembrane    liner.  The model does not permit a vertical percolation layer to be placed     below a lateral drainage layer.  A barrier soil liner may not be underlying     another barrier soil liner.  Geomembranes cannot envelop a barrier soil         liner and barrier soil liners cannot envelop a geomembrane.  The top layer      may not be a liner.  If a liner is not placed directly below the lowest         lateral drainage layer, the lateral drainage layers in the lowest subprofile    are treated by the model as vertical percolation layers.  No other              restrictions are placed on the order of the layers.                                                                                                                  The lateral drainage equation was developed for the expected range of      hazardous waste landfill design specifications.  Permissible ranges for         slope of the drainage layer are 0 to 50 percent.  Due to dimensionless          structure of the lateral drainage equation, there are no practical limits in    the maximum drainage length.                                                                                                                                         Several interrelationships must exist between the soil characteristics     of a layer and of the soil subprofile.  The porosity, field capacity and        wilting point can theoretically range from 0 to 1 units of volume per           volume; however, the porosity must be greater than the field capacity, and      the field capacity must be greater than the wilting point.  Initial soil        moisture storage must be greater than or equal to the wilting point and less    than or equal to the porosity.  The initial moisture content of liners must     be equal to the porosity and the liners remain saturated.  The field            capacity and wilting point values are not used for barrier soil liners.         Values for porosity, field capacity and wilting point are not needed for        geomembranes.                                                                                                                                                        Surface runoff from adjacent areas does not run onto the landfill, and     the physical characteristics of the landfill specified by the user remain       constant over the modeling period.  No adjustments are made for the changes     that occur in these characteristics as the landfill ages.  Additionally, the    program cannot model the filling process within a single simulation.  Aging     of materials and staging of the landfill operation must be modeled by           successive simulations.                                                                                                                                         Default Soil Characteristics                                                                                                                                         The HELP model contains default values of soil characteristics based on    soil texture class.  The documentation for Version 3 describes the origin of    these default values (Schroeder et al., 1993).  Recommended default values      for leaf area index and evaporative depth based on thick loamy top soils are    given in the program.                                                                                                                                           Manual Soil Characteristics                                                                                                                                          The HELP model computes values for the three Brooks-Corey parameters as    described in the documentation for Version 3 (Schroeder et al., 1994) based     on the values for porosity, field capacity and wilting point.                                                                                                   Soil Moisture Initialization                                                                                                                                         The soil moisture of the layers may be initialized by the user or the      program.  When initialized by the program, the process consists of three        steps.  The first step sets the soil moisture of all layers except barrier      soil liners equal to field capacity and all barrier soil liners to porosity     (saturation).  In the second step, the program computes a soil moisture for     each layer below the top barrier soil liner.  These soil moisture contents      are computed to yield an unsaturated hydraulic conductivity equal to 85         percent of the lowest effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of the all     liner systems above the layer, including consideration for the presence of a    synthetic geomembrane liner.  If the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is      less than 1 x 10-6 cm/sec and if the computed soil moisture is greater than     field capacity, the soil moisture is set to equal computed soil moisture        instead of the field capacity.  The third step in the initialization            consists of running the model for one year of simulation using the first        year of climate data and the initial soil moisture values selected in step      2.  At the end of this year of initialization, the soil moisture values         existing at that point are reported as the initial soil moisture values.        The simulation is then restarted using the first year of climate data.                                                                                        #U4HELP
