#MAINMENU                                                                                                                                                         4.3  PROGRAM STRUCTURE                                                                                                                                               The flow or logic of the input facility of the HELP program may be         viewed as a tree structure.  The tree structure is made up of nodes which       are the points where new branches of the tree are started.  The first node      is called the trunk, root or parent node, and the terminal nodes of the tree    are called leaves.  All components (nodes) of the tree structure in the HELP    model are screens that have different functions as defined previously, with     the trunk node being the Main Menu.  During an input session, the user          should reach the leaf node if all the data for a given branch (module) are      entered.  Some of the nodes (screens) are common to more than one branch.       The user must return to the node where the branch started in order to go to     another branch.  These movements are made simple by using the special keys      discussed above such as Page Up, Page Down, F9, F10, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                       4.4  THE MAIN MENU                                                                                                                                                   When the program is started, the main menu is displayed.  A schematic      of the main menu in Figure 3 of the User's Guide shows the seven available      modules (branches).  Selection from the main menu is made by either moving      the cursor to the desired module or by pressing the number of that option.      Once a selection is made, program control transfers into an environment         specific of that option and cannot transfer to another main menu option         without exiting that environment to the main menu and then selecting another    option.  A brief description of each main menu option is presented below.       More details are given in Option 6 of the main menu about specific data         requirements for each option.                                                                                                                                        Option 1 on the main menu is "Enter/Edit Weather Data."  This module       permits the user to read evapotranspiration, precipitation, temperature, and    solar radiation data files and then review, edit, and save the data or          create new files.  There are four primary screens in this module; they are a    file selection screen, evapotranspiration data screen, a screen that            controls the method used for specifying precipitation, temperature and solar    radiation data, and a screen for saving weather data files.  Several options    are available for specifying precipitation, temperature and solar radiations    data.  These vary from using default data (for precipitation only) to           synthetic and other user-defined data sources, such as NOAA Tape,               Climatedata, ASCII data, HELP Version 2 data, and Canadian Climatological       data.  Data may also be entered manually.  Default and synthetic weather        data retrieval is performed by selecting the city of interest from a list       of cities and specifying (optional) additional data.                                                                                                                 Option 2 on the main menu is "Enter/Edit Soil and Design Data."  This      module allows the user to read an already existing soil and design data file    and then review, edit, and save the data or create a new data file.  There      are eight primary screens in the soil and design data module; they are a        file selection screen, a landfill general information screen, three screens     for entering design, soil and geomembrane liner data by layers, a screen for    entering a runoff curve number, a data verification screen and a screen for     saving the soil and design data file.  Input screens associated with this       module provides cells for entering project title; system of units; initial      soil conditions; landfill area; layer design information such as layer type,    thickness, soil texture, drainage characteristics; geomembrane liner            information; and runoff curve number information including the ability to       adjust curve number as a function of surface slope and length.  At the end      of this module the user may request that the data be checked for possible       violation of the design rules explained in the User's Guide and the help        messages.  Under this module, the HELP model verifies the design data, soil     and geomembrane liner properties and layer arrangement.                                                                                                              Option 3 on the main menu is "Execute Simulation."  In this option the     user defines the data files to be used in running the simulation component      of the HELP model and selects the output frequency and simulation duration      desired from execution.  In this option the user can also view the list of      files available and can make file selections from these lists.                                                                                                       Option 4 on the main menu is "View Results."  This option allows the       user to browse through the output file in order to examine the results of       the run after executing the program.  Option 5 is "Print Results," and          Option 6 is "Display Guidance" on general landfill design procedures and on     the HELP model itself.  This option displays much of the text of the User's     Guide and makes reference to Figures and Sections of the User's Guide.          Finally, Option 7 is to "Quit" the HELP model and return to DOS.                                                                                                     In the following sections, detailed explanations of the main menu          options are presented, and methods of data entry to the program and various     options are discussed.                                                                                                                                        #MAINMENU                                                                       #MAINCLIM                                                                                                                                                         4.5  WEATHER DATA                                                                                                                                                    As mentioned above, this module is selected from the main menu by          pressing 1, "Enter/Edit Weather Data."  A schematic of this module is shown     in Figure 4.  In this module the user can specify all of the weather data       (evapotranspiration, precipitation, temperature and solar radiation)            required to run the model.  The four primary screens in this module are         "Weather Data - File Editing", "Evapotranspiration Data", "Precipitation,       Temperature, and Solar Radiation Data", and "Weather Data - File Saving".       Several secondary screens may appear during the session depending upon the      action taken by the user.  On-line help screens are always available for        display by pressing F1 or F2.  The individual primary screens and their         secondary screens of this module are discussed below.                                                                                                         #MAINCLIM                                                                       #MAINSOIL                                                                                                                                                         4.6  SOIL AND DESIGN DATA                                                                                                                                            This module is selected from the main menu by pressing 2, "Enter/Edit      Soil and Design."  While in this module the user will be able to enter site     information, a landfill profile, layer design data, characteristics of          soils, geomembranes and other materials, and SCS runoff curve number            information.  The primary screens in this module are the "Soil and Design       Data - File Editing" screen, "Landfill General Information" screen, three       Landfill Profile Design and Layer Data screens, "Runoff Curve Number            Information" screen, "Verification and Saving" screen and "Soil and Design      Data - File Saving" screen.  Several secondary screens may appear during the    session depending upon the action taken by the user.  On-line help screens      are always available for display by pressing F1 or F2.   The individual         primary screens and their secondary screens of this module are discussed        below.  Figure 12 shows a schematic of the soil and design data module.                                                                                       #MAINSOIL                                                                       #EXECFILES                                                                      #MAINEXEC                                                                                                                                                         4.7  EXECUTING SIMULATION                                                                                                                                            Option 3 on the main menu is "Execute Simulation."  This option is         composed of two primary screens:  "Execution Files - File Management" screen    and "Output Selection" screen and is shown schematically in Figure 18.        #MAINEXEC                                                                                                                                                         Execution Files                                                                                                                                                      This screen is used to define the weather and soil and design data         files that contain the data to be used in the simulation conducted by the       HELP model.  Six files must be specified in order to run HELP model.  The       input data files required are a precipitation data file, a temperature data     file, a solar radiation data file, an evapotranspiration data file, and a       soil and design data file; and for output, the HELP model requires one file     on which the results are to be written.                                       #EFILE                                                                                                                                                                 The user must enter the file names without extension since the HELP        model recognizes the following extensions for the various types of files:                                                                                            .D4 for precipitation data                                                      .D7 for temperature data                                                        .D11 for evapotranspiration data                                                .D13 for solar radiation data                                                   .D10 for soil and design data                                                   .OUT for the output                                                      #EPATH                                                                                                                                                                 When the program initially displays the "Execution Files - File            Management" screen, the program lists the default directory name in each        cell in the directory column and the file names of each type of data that       were used in the last simulation.  The user should enter the directory, if      different than the default directory, for each type of file.  If an invalid     directory is entered, the program displays the message "INVALID DIRECTORY"      and replaces the directory with the default directory.  If user enters a        file name that could not be found on the specified directory, then the          program displays the message "FILE NOT FOUND" and erases the file name.       #EPATH                                                                                                                                                                 As shown in Figure 18, the user may obtain a list of all files that        reside on the current directory by pressing F4.  By pressing F4, the program    obtains a directory of all files that pertain to the type of file at the        cell where F4 was pressed.  For example, if F4 was pressed from the             temperature file cell, the program will display the list of files with          extension D7 that reside on the current directory displayed in temperature      file row.  Up to 120 data files for any file type can be displayed on a         separate screen.  The name of the current directory where these files are       located is also displayed.  The user can obtain the list of data files with     the same extension that are available in another valid directory by entering    the name of that directory in the column labeled DIRECTORY and on the same      row as the file type of interest.                                                                                                                                    To select a file from the list of displayed files, move the cursor to      the file and select it by pressing Enter.  This transfers control back to       the previous screen and the name of the file just selected will be displayed    in the proper cell.  The user can exit the list-of-files screen without         selecting a file by pressing the Esc key.                                     #EFILE                                                                                                                                                                 Once file names have been selected, the user can proceed to the next       screen of the execution module by pressing Page Down or F10.  If the output     file already exists, the user is prompted with a warning indicating that        this file already exists.  The program then asks whether the file should be     overwritten.  If the user answers "No", the program moves the cursor to the     output file name cell so that the user can enter a new file name.  If the       user answers "Yes", the program proceeds to the "Output Selection" screen.      Before displaying the next screen, the program reads the weather data files     to determine the maximum allowable simulation period.                                                                                                         #EXECFILES                                                                      #OUTPUTITEMS                                                                                                                                                      Output Selection                                                              #OUTPUTYEARS                                                                                                                                                           On this screen, the user selects the units of the HELP model output,       the number of years to simulate, and the output frequency.  The user may use    a maximum of 100 years of simulation provided that weather data is available    for that many years.  If the weather data in the selected files have a          different number of years, the HELP model allows the simulation period to be    no larger than the smallest number of years available in any of the daily       weather data files.  If the simulation period selected is smaller than the      maximum allowable period, the program will use the years of weather data        starting at the top of the files.                                             #OUTPUTYEARS                                                                    #OUTPUTOPTIONS                                                                                                                                                         The rest of the information available on this screen is for selecting      the type of optional output desired (daily, monthly or annual).  Daily          output in units of length consists of the daily precipitation, runoff,          evapotranspiration, moisture content of the evaporative zone, head on each      liner, leakage through each liner and collection from the surface of each       liner as well as indicators as to whether the air or soil temperature was       below freezing.  Monthly output contains the cumulative monthly totals in       units of length for precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration, leakage          through each liner and collection from the surface of each liner, and           recirculation into and from each subprofile, as well as the average head on     each liner during each month and the standard deviation of the daily values.    Annual output contains the cumulative annual totals for each year of            simulation for the same parameters as the monthly output.  In addition the      annual output provides information on change in moisture storage and            subsurface inflow.  Annual totals are in units of length, volume and percent    of the precipitation.  The user may select any, all or none of the available    options.  The program will always write the summary output to the output        file as well as a description of the input data.  In order to select            additional or different output frequencies, move the cursor to the desired      output frequency and type "Y" for yes.  Once all execution files and output     frequency data are selected, the user should press Page Down or F10 to start    the simulation.  To move back to the "Execution Files" screen, press Page       Up.                                                                           #OUTPUTOPTIONS                                                                  #OUTPUTITEMS                                                                    #VIEWFILE                                                                       #MAINVIEW                                                                                                                                                         4.8  VIEWING RESULTS                                                                                                                                                 Option 4 on the main menu is to view the results of execution.  This       option is used to browse through the output file before printing.  Figure 19    is a schematic of this option.  The program displays the "View Results"         screen.                                                                       #MAINVIEW                                                                                                                                                              The user should enter the desired directory and file name.  The file       name can be selected from a list of files by pressing F4.  After selecting      the file, press Page Down or F10 to display the selected file.  The viewing     function uses the LIST program and instructions on its use are available on     screen by typing ? or F1.  To display other types of files, first enter the     extension of the file of interest, then the directory and the file name.  To    return to the main menu, press Page Down or F10.                                                                                                              #VIEWFILE                                                                       #FILE                                                                                                                                                                  This cell and screen is for specifying the file that is to be viewed or    printed.  A schematic of this screen is shown in Figure 19 or 20.  In this      cell the user must enter the file name (up to 8 characters without a path,      extension or ".") of an existing file or select a filename from a directory     listing using the F4 option.  The defaults for file selection is for output     files (those having an extension of ".OUT") on the default directory.  The      data file may have any valid DOS name of up to 8 characters.  If the user       enters an illegal file name, the program displays "BAD FILE NAME" and           clears the file name.  If the user specifies a file name that does not          exist, the program displays "FILE NOT FOUND" and clears the file name.  If      the user wishes to view a files that is not an output file, he must first       enter the correct extension and directory before entering the file name.      #EXTENSION                                                                                                                                                             When desiring to view or print a non-output file, the user must specify    the extension in the rightmost cell of this screen.  The extension should be    entered without the "." in the cell.  Only ASCII files should be selected       for viewing or printing.  The data files for the HELP model can be viewed or    printed by this utility if their extensions are specified.  The F4 option       will display the list of files on the specified directory with the currently    specified extension.                                                          #EXTENSION                                                                      #PATH                                                                                                                                                                  When selecting a file to be viewed or printed, the DOS path may be         specified if different from the active or default drive and subdirectory,       such as C:\HELP3\DATA.  The default directory is initially displayed in the     directory cell on the screen.  If the user specifies a drive or a directory     that does not exist, the program will display respectively "INVALID DRIVE"      or "INVALID DIRECTORY" and replaces the content with the default directory.     As shown in Figures 19 and 20, the user may obtain a listing of all files       with the specified extension that reside on the directory currently             specified in the directory cell by pressing F4.  Up to 120 data files can be    displayed on the screen.  The name of the current directory where these         files are located is also displayed.  To change to another directory, the       user should enter the name of that directory in the column labeled              DIRECTORY.  To select a file from the list of displayed files, move the         cursor to the file and select it by pressing Enter.  This transfers control     back to the previous screen and the name of the file just selected will be      displayed in the proper cell.  The user can exit the list-of-files screen       without selecting a file by pressing F4 again or Esc.                         #PATH                                                                           #FILE                                                                           #PRINTFILE                                                                      #MAINPRINT                                                                                                                                                        4.9  PRINTING RESULTS                                                                                                                                                Option 5 on the main menu is used to print the output file.  Figure 20     is a schematic of this option.  The program displays the "Print Results"        screen.                                                                       #MAINPRINT                                                                                                                                                             The user should enter the desired directory and file name.  The file       name can be selected from a list of files by pressing F4.  After selecting      the file, press Page Down or F10 to print the selected file.  The print         function uses the DOS PRINT command and instructions on its use are             available in a DOS manual.  To print other types of files, first enter the      extension of the file of interest, then the directory and the file name.  To    return to the main menu, press Page Down or F10.                                                                                                              #PRINTFILE                                                                      #MAINUSER                                                                                                                                                         4.10  DISPLAYING GUIDANCE                                                                                                                                            On-line help is provided throughout the program using the F1, F2 and       F3 keys.  The program will display information from the User's Guide and        refer to sections, figures and tables in the User's Guide.  Option 6 on         the main menu gives an overview of the HELP program, as well as, general        criteria for landfill design.  Most of the User's Guide is displayed within     the option.                                                                   #MAINUSER                                                                       #MAINQUIT                                                                                                                                                         4.11  QUITTING HELP                                                                                                                                                  Option 7 on the main menu is to exit the HELP program and return to        DOS.                                                                          #MAINQUIT                                                                       #UNITS                                                                                                                                                            8.  System of Units.  Throughout the HELP program the user is required to           select a system of units.  The HELP model allows the user to use either         the customary system of units (a mixture of U.S. and metric units               traditionally used in landfill design and in Version 2 of the HELP              model) or the Metric system of units.  The user is not restricted to the        same system for all data types; for example, the soil and design data           can be in one system of units and the weather data can be in the other          system.  Moreover, it is not necessary for all types of weather data to         have the same system of units, i.e. evapotranspiration data may be in           the Metric system of units while precipitation data can be in customary         units; the solar radiation data can be in customary units while                 temperature data can be Metric units, and so on.  Appropriate units are         displayed in proper locations to keep the user aware of which units             should be used for each data entry.  Consistency in units is only               required within each data type.                                           #UNITS
