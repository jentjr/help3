   not be handled by other compilers.  Others are corrections of the 
   HELP3O.EXE simulation code.
   
    1.  Initialization of variables for other compilers.

    2.  Prevention of division by zero error due to zero drainage slope 
          or drainage length.

    3.  Corrected computation of daily location in the growing season.

    4.  Corrected computation of snowmelt factor for latitudes between
          50 and 60 degrees.

                  HELP Version 3.06 Revision (8/17/96)
   
   HELP Version 3.05a was released without updating the source code,
   the example problem, main menu and logo screens.  Version 3.06  
   provides the final updates started in Version 3.05a.  In addition,
   the following improvements were made:                
   
    1.  Modification of the Canadian weather data import utilities to 
        better accomodate missing data and incomplete data files.

                  HELP Version 3.05 Revision (3/30/96)
   
   A number of revisions of HELP Version 3.04a has been made to create
   HELP Version 3.05.  The revisions include:
   
    1.  Corrected the snowmelt factors in the simulation program HELP3O,
        reducing the daily snowmelt by about a factor of 5.
   
    2.  Modified the default path for viewing and printing output in
        the H3MENU program.

                  HELP Version 3.04a Revision (8/05/95)
   
    1.  The MOUND equation was replaced with McEnroe's equations for
        all cases except for near-zero slope conditions (<0.3%).
   
   

                  HELP Version 3.04 Revisions (4/10/95)
   
   A number of revisions to HELP Version 3.03 have been made to create
   HELP Version 3.04.  The revisions include:
   
    1.  Corrected the directory and path routines in the WEATHER, DESIGN
        OUTPUT programs to handle the root directory and not put or
        allow multiple \'s at the end of the path.

    2.  Changed the path routines in the WEATHER and DESIGN programs to
        retain the paths used in the edit screen and use it as the 
        default in the save routine.  Similarly, the OUTPUT program was
        changed to retain the paths used in the previous execution of
        the simulation routine.

    3.  Changed the labels for heads values in the output from the HELP3O
        program to consistently state "AVERAGE HEAD ON TOP OF LAYER" for 
        all levels of output.  Also, the layer number was corrected for
        composite liners to report the layer number of the uppermost liner
        of the composite system when reporting the head values.

    4.  Added a check in the WEATHER program to verify that the specified
        evaporative zone depth is greater than zero. 
        
    5.  Corrected default normal mean monthly rainfall for Knoxville, TN
        and default growing season for Topeka, KS in TAPE2.NEW.  
        
    6.  Added printing of the latitude used to generate synthetic solar 
        radiation to the output from simulation program (HELP3O).
        
    7.  Added printing of the evaporative zone depth under the heading of
        evapotranspiration data in the simulation program (HELP3O).
        
    8.  Corrected the synthetic weather generator (program SYNGEN) to adjust 
        for latitude and to work for locations in the southern hemisphere.
        
    9.  Added instructions in the WEATHER program and help messages to inform
        users to use negative values for latitudes in the southern hemisphere.
        
   10.  Corrected import of HELP Version 2 temperature and solar radiation   
        data in the WEATHER program to include the years of the data, which is
        needed for execution of the simulation.
        
   11.  Corrected reading of evapotranspiration data file in HELP3O simulation
        program for data that was built by converting from conventional to 
        metric units.
        
   12.  Corrected lateral drainage solution for larger heads and condition for 
        use of nonlinear approximation of lateral drainage solution in the 
        simulation program HELP3O.  Previous error leads to a somewhat high
        estimate (perhaps 50% too large) of the peak head when greater than
        about six inches.
        
   13.  Added computation of the maximum head for the peak average heads using
        the MOUND equation by Moore (1983) for steady-state drainage and 
        listed the results in peak output section of the simulation results 
        from the program HELP3O.
   
   14.  Modified daily evaporative zone moisture content output to be the end
        of day value instead of value at midpoint of last timestep in the 
        daily output from the simulation program HELP3O.  
   
   15.  Changed timestep calculation to account properly for units.  The 
        timestep may increase in some cases and speed up the simulation in
        program HELP3O. 
   
   16.  Corrected evapotranspiration from frozen soil, preventing evaporation 
        from the soil whenever it is frozen or the mean temperature is less 
        than -5 degrees Celsius in simulation program HELP3O.  Similarly, 
        drainage is restricted from the evaporative zone when the soil is 
        frozen.
   
   17.  Modified drainage routines to reduce total daily evapotranspiration
        if previous unsaturated drainage during the day lowered the soil to 
        the point where applying the remainder of the daily evapotranspiration
        would lower the soil moisture below the wilting point.  This prevents
        the soil moisture from falling below the wilting point under any 
        circumstance during the simulation with program HELP3O.
   
   18.  Modified drainage routines in program HELP3O to permit drainage from
        the evaporative zone only when the moisture content of the segment is
        above field capacity, there is drainage into the segment or the
        segment directly below has greater soil suction.  The same rules are
        applied to vertical percolation layers placed below the lowest liner.

   19.  Fixed the printing of the number of years for synthetic weather 
        generation in program WEATHER.

   20.  Corrected yearly initialization of ponded water in the simulation 
        program HELP3O.
   
   21.  Corrected computation of layer soil moisture at end of the simulation
        or the initialization when no liners are used in program HELP3O.
   
   22.  Updated version number, example and source codes.

    1.  Corrected the printing of area and label for recirculation into
        a layer when metric units are used.

    2.  Corrected the calculation of volumetric totals for water budget
        components in cubic metres due to error in units conversion for
        area in HELP3O program.

    3.  Corrected initialization of subsurface inflow and annual 
        initialization of recirculation variables, snow metric totals
        and soil water metric totals in HELP3O program.
